abstract={Scientific workflows organize the assembly of specialized software into an overall data flow and are particularly well suited for multi-step analyses using different types of software tools. They are also favorable in terms of reusability, as previously designed workflows could be made publicly available through the myExperiment community and then used in other workflows. We here illustrate how scientific workflows and the Taverna workbench in particular can be used in bibliometrics. We discuss the specific capabilities of Taverna that makes this software a powerful tool in this field, such as automated data import via Web services, data extraction from XML by XPaths, and statistical analysis and visualization with R. The support of the latter is particularly relevant, as it allows integration of a number of recently developed R packages specifically for bibliometrics. Examples are used to illustrate the possibilities of Taverna in the fields of bibliometrics and scientometrics. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The ground source heat pump (GSHP) is one of the most promising energy-efficient technologies in development. However, the degree to which the application of GSHP has been promoted in China remains unsatisfactory. Critics of GSHP development in China have asserted that a more thorough understanding of GSHP is paramount for technology road mapping. This, in turn, has affected policymakers' development of regulations that facilitate R&D related to GSHP. Because many researchers have proposed specific terms and categorization approaches in relation to GSHP, it is imperative to transform and analyze a substantive knowledge system derived from massive amounts of qualitative information to produce a roadmap for the development of GSHP. To this end, we employed a bibiliometrics approach to analyze patent information. First, we engaged in semantic labeling of patent files and recorded the co-occurrence of the terms associated with the GSHP's ontology. Second, we employed an algorithm called the Fuzzy Overlapping Cluster (FOPC) to analyze the co-occurrence information. In doing so, we sought to classify patent data and further define sub-technologies associated with GSHP. Third, we used accumulative patent numbers to develop a logistic model for observing development trends related to each GHSP sub-technology. Fourth, we leveraged social network analysis to calculate and graphically illustrate interdependence among GSHP sub-technologies. The results these analytic approaches produce allowed us to conclude that (a) GSHP should be categorized into four sub-technologies: the water source heat pump, the ground coupled heat pump, the heat pump/system operation technique, and central air-conditioning system, and (b) the government should revise building codes and standards with a consideration of GCHP, as well as the heat pump/system operation techniques. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As federal programs are held more accountable for their research investments, The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has developed a new method to quantify the impact of our funded research on the scientific and broader communities. In this article we review traditional bibliometric analyses, address challenges associated with them, and describe a new bibliometric analysis method, the Automated Research Impact Assessment (ARIA). ARIA taps into a resource that has only rarely been used for bibliometric analyses: references cited in “important” research artifacts, such as policies, regulations, clinical guidelines, and expert panel reports. The approach includes new statistics that science managers can use to benchmark contributions to research by funding source. This new method provides the ability to conduct automated impact analyses of federal research that can be incorporated in program evaluations. We apply this method to several case studies to examine the impact of NIEHS funded research. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Traditionally, the success of a researcher is assessed by the number of publications he or she publishes in peer-reviewed, indexed, high impact journals. This essential yardstick, often referred to as the impact of a specific researcher, is assessed through the use of various metrics. While researchers may be acquainted with such matrices, many do not know how to use them to enhance their careers. In addition to these metrics, a number of other factors should be taken into consideration to objectively evaluate a scientist′s profile as a researcher and academician. Moreover, each metric has its own limitations that need to be considered when selecting an appropriate metric for evaluation. This paper provides a broad overview of the wide array of metrics currently in use in academia and research. Popular metrics are discussed and defined, including traditional metrics and article-level metrics, some of which are applied to researchers for a greater understanding of a particular concept, including varicocele that is the thematic area of this Special Issue of Asian Journal of Andrology. We recommend the combined use of quantitative and qualitative evaluation using judiciously selected metrics for a more objective assessment of scholarly output and research impact. © 2016 AJA, SIMM & SJTU.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to investigate the consequences of the bibliometrics-based evaluation system of scientific production on the contents and methods of sciences. The research has been conducted by means of in-depth interviews to a multi-disciplinary panel of Italian researchers. We discuss the implications of bibliometrics-based evaluation on the choice of the research topic, on the experimental practices, on the dissemination habits. We observe that the validation of the bibliometrics-based evaluation practices relies on the acceptance and diffusion within the scientific community, and that these practices are self-sustained through their wide application. We discuss possible evolving scenarios, also considering the recent development of digital archives. © 2016 Taylor & Francis},

abstract={Publication keywords have been widely utilized to reveal the knowledge structure of research domains. An important but under-addressed problem is the decision of which keywords should be retained as analysis objects after a great number of keywords are gathered from domain publications. In this paper, we discuss the problems with the traditional term frequency (TF) method and introduce two alternative methods: TF-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and TF-Keyword Activity Index (TF-KAI). These two methods take into account keyword discrimination by considering their frequency both in and out of the domain. To test their performance, the keywords they select in China's Digital Library domain are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The evaluation results show that the TF-KAI method performs the best: it can retain keywords that match expert selection much better and reveal the research specialization of the domain with more details. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Context: An enormous number of papers (more than 70,000) have been published in the area of Software Engineering (SE) since its inception in 1968. To better characterize and understand this massive research literature, there is a need for comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Objective: The objective of this study is to utilize automated citation and topic analysis to characterize the software engineering research literature over the years. While a few bibliometrics studies have appeared in the field of SE, this article aims to be the most comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Method: To achieve the above objective, we report in this paper a bibliometrics study with data collected from Scopus database consisting of over 70,000 articles. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data.Results: We found that number of papers published per year has grown tremendously and currently 6000-7000 papers are published every year. At the same time, nearly half of the papers are not cited at all. Using text mining of articles titles, we found that currently the hot research topics in software engineering are: (1) web services, (2) mobile and cloud computing, (3) industrial (case) studies, (4) source code and (5) test generation. Finally, we found that a small share of large countries produce the majority of the papers in SE while small European countries are proportionally the most active in the area of SE, based on the number of papers.Conclusion: Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper. By picking out the most cited papers, we can present the land marks of SE and, with thematic analysis, we can characterize the entire field. This can be useful for students and other new comers to SE and for presenting our achievements to other disciplines. In particular, we see and report the value of such an analysis in situations where performing a full scale SLR is not feasible due to restrictions on time or to lack of exact research questions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In the humanities and social sciences, bibliometric methods for the assessment of research performance are (so far) less common. This study uses a concrete example in an attempt to evaluate a research institute from the area of social sciences and humanities with the help of data from Google Scholar (GS). In order to use GS for a bibliometric study, we developed procedures for the normalization of citation impact, building on the procedures of classical bibliometrics. In order to test the convergent validity of the normalized citation impact scores, we calculated normalized scores for a subset of the publications based on data from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Even if scores calculated with the help of GS and the WoS/Scopus are not identical for the different publication types (considered here), they are so similar that they result in the same assessment of the institute investigated in this study: For example, the institute's papers whose journals are covered in the WoS are cited at about an average rate (compared with the other papers in the journals). © 2016 by ASIS&T.},

abstract={Bibliometrics are often used as key indicators when evaluating academic groups and individual researchers in biomedical research. Citation metrics, when used as indicators of research performance, require accurate benchmarking for homogenous groups. This study describes the research performance of academic departments in the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine using article-level bibliometrics for scientific papers published from 2008 to 2012. Eligible publications of all academic faculty members were verified from each researcher’s curriculum vitae and Web of Science® (Thomson Reuters). For 3792 researchers, we identified 26,845 unique papers with 79,502 authors published from 2008 to 2012. The overall mean citations per paper for the faculty was 17.35. The academic departments with the highest levels of collaboration and interdisciplinary research activity also had the highest research impact. The citation window for biomedical scientific papers was still active at 5 years after publication, indicating that the citation window for publications in biomedical research is active longer than previously thought, and this may hinder the reliable use of bibliometrics when evaluating recent scientific publications in biomedical research. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={The market of flat panel displays is experiencing rapid growth with the advancement of digital technologies in broadcasting service. The next challenge of LCD is OLED in TV market. The study attempts to investigate the trends in advanced or emerging technologies by determining their technology diffusion rates due to the lack of experiential data. With the development of information and communication technology, one of the recent methods to assist in technology forecasting is data mining in bibliometric or textual data from various sources such as patents, journals, and research awards. The information extracted from diverse sources can be employed in technology diffusion models such as Fisher-Pry where emerging technologies substitute older ones. The study uses web of science and compendex for bibliometric analysis to forecast the growth of next-generation OLED technologies based on the analogous growths of LCD technologies. © 2014 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to assess China’s R&D position and status on salt lake resources with a method combining bibliometrics with social network analysis. Patent data about the mining and usage of salt lake resources harvested from the SciFinder database and ranging from 1991 to 2010 is analyzed in this paper. The results show that there has been a rapid growth in patent publications regarding salt lake resources in the last 20 years, both at home and abroad. This is especially true with regard to the extraction and application of magnesium and potassium. China’s R&D in this field is worthy of attention, because China owns considerable salt lake reserves. The status of R&D groups in China is assessed via network analysis, through both Ucinet software and NetDraw software. We use separate records from the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) and the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), covering the time span from 2001 to 2010. A collaboration network is established, and its structure and attributes are analyzed with a view to assessing the R&D groups in this field. Results from these analysis demonstrated that China stands in a disadvantaged position in the implementation of related research and technology; several research groups have been formed to explore the mining of salt lake resources; Collaboration is mostly still confined to the domestic scene; cross-national collaboration has not yet started to grow. Finally, proposals are put forward for the formulation of an R&D strategy and for cultivating R&D groups. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to present a novel method for combining bibliometrics and scenario technique for the sake of conducting technology foresight. First, we derive an eight-step scenario approach and add the identification of emerging technologies as well as their respective effects on each scenario. Second, we illustrate this combined method in the field of personalized medicine (PM). Existing literature on method combination often focuses singular challenges and benefits associated with the scenario technique. In this paper, however, we integrate the results of a bibliometric analysis at each step of the scenario technique. Herein, we refer mainly to the co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling network. Third, we describe the findings of our case study for every step of the application of the scenario technique. In doing so, we offer practical guidelines for applying this novel combined method in other contexts. The overall benefit of the method combination is the integration of scientifically based information that exceeds the knowledge bases of the scenario team and other experts. Most notably, the examination of vast amounts of technology-specific information facilitates the identification of emerging technologies. Moreover, the combined method allows for a more precise projection of future states when narrowing the scenario funnel. Using this eight-step scenario approach, we build three scenarios for the field of PM, discuss disruptive events, and identify and integrate emerging technologies into each scenario. Finally, we explore strategic decisions for various stakeholders in the PM field. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are one of the most viable technologies to achieve the goals of energy saving and environmental protection before a breakthrough in battery technology and fuel cell technology. Energy management strategy as a key technology of HEVs is studied extensively and deeply to improve the performance of HEVs and speed up the industrialization of HEVs. This paper quantitatively analyzes and evaluates current research status of energy management strategies for HEVs based on bibliometrics for the first time, through content analysis involving analysis of author keywords and abstracts. Then qualitative analysis is performed for all kinds of energy management strategies that are used in HEVs in detail, essential characteristics involving pros and cons, interconnections and improvement potential among various energy management strategies are revealed from the view of control theory. Finally, latest developing trends in energy management strategies of HEVs are presented to improve the performance of HEVs based on above quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, covering driving cycle recognition/prediction algorithms, integrated multi-objective, coordinated optimization energy management strategies, good balance between computation complexity and optimization performance of energy management strategies, fair and credible evaluation system of energy management strategies. This paper not only first provides a comprehensive analysis of energy management strategies for HEVs, but also puts forward the emphasis and orientation of future study, which will broaden relevant researchers' vision and promote the development of a simple and practical energy management controller with low cost and high performance for HEVs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Emerging industries are attracting increasing attention as they engage in innovation activities that transgress the boundaries of science and technology. Policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric/workshop methods have limitations when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions between science, technology, application, and the mass market. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping (TRM) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new, technology-based industry. The dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in China is selected as a case study. In this case, the bibliometrics method is applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and TRM workshops are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and marketing. Key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based industry have been identified. This paper will contribute to the roadmapping and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry researchers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed evaluation of type 2 diabetes mellitus research output from 1951-2012, using large-scale data analysis, bibliometric indicators and density-equalizing mapping. Data were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded database, one of the seven curated databases withinWeb of Science. Using Boolean operators "OR", "AND" and "NOT", a search strategy was developed to estimate the total number of published items. Only studies with an English abstract were eligible. Type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes items were excluded. Specific software developed for the database analysed the data. Information including titles, authors' affiliations and publication years were extracted from all files and exported to excel. Density-equalizing mapping was conducted as described by Groenberg-Kloft et al, 2008. A total of 24,783 items were published and cited 476,002 times. The greatest number of outputs were published in 2010 (n=2,139). The United States contributed 28.8% to the overall output, followed by the United Kingdom (8.2%) and Japan (7.7%). Bilateral cooperation was most common between the United States and United Kingdom (n=237). Harvard University produced 2% of all publications, followed by the University of California (1.1%). The leading journals were Diabetes, Diabetologia and Diabetes Care and they contributed 9.3%, 7.3% and 4.0% of the research yield, respectively. In conclusion, the volume of research is rising in parallel with the increasing global burden of disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bibliometrics analysis provides useful information to scientists and funding agencies involved in the development and implementation of research strategies to address global health issues. © 2015 Geaney et al.},

abstract={The discipline of bibliometrics involves the application of mathematical and statistical methods to scholarly publications. The first attempts at systematic data collection were provided by Alfred Lotka and Samuel Bradford, who subsequently established the foundational laws of bibliometrics. Eugene Garfield ushered in the modern era of bibliometrics with the routine use of citation analysis and systematized processing. Key elements of bibliometric analysis include database coverage, consistency and accuracy of the data, data fields, search options, and analysis and use of metrics. A number of bibliometric applications are currently being used in medical science and health care. Bibliometric parameters and indexes may be increasingly used by grant funding sources as measures of research success. Universities may build benchmarking standards from bibliometric data to determine academic achievement through promotion and tenure guidelines in the future. This article reviews the history, definition, laws, and elements of bibliometric principles and provides examples of bibliometric applications to the broader health care community. To accomplish this, the Medline (1966-2014) and Web of Science (1945-2014) databases were searched to identify relevant articles; select articles were also cross-referenced. Articles selected were those that provided background, history, descriptive analysis, and application of bibliometric principles and metrics to medical science and health care. No attempt was made to cover all areas exhaustively; rather, key articles were chosen that illustrate bibliometric concepts and enhance the reader's knowledge. It is important that faculty and researchers understand the limitations and appropriate uses of bibliometric data. Bibliometrics has considerable potential as a research area for health care scientists and practitioners that can be used to discover new information about academic trends, pharmacotherapy, disease, and broader health sciences trends. © 2015 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},

abstract={In scientometrics, citer behavior is traditionally investigated using one of two main approaches. According to the normative point of view, the behavior of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures. According to the constructivist perspective, citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that are useful for the purposes of interpretation. An intermediate position supports normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts. In this paper, this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community. Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three "political" or "ideological" camps, and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially strong constructivist reason to cite. An all-author co-citation analysis was performed to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence of three camps. We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the co-citation map. The map, in fact, included authors who obtained high citation counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior. The results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according to topic and not by camp. Relevant scientific works were cited by the members of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp. © 2014 ASIS&T.},

We present the issues raised by the simplistic use of these methods and recall the dangers of using poorly built indicators and technically defective rankings that do not measure the dimensions they are supposed to measure, for example the <<quality>> of publications, laboratories or universities. We show that francophone journals are particularly susceptible to suffer from the bad uses of too simplistic bibliometric rankings of scientific journals.},

abstract={The interest for food waste (FW) in the scientific community has been growing consistently in the most recent years. This is reflected by the number of publications (journal articles and proceedings papers) which can be accessed in the Web of Science (WoS) database. However, lacking of systematic, chronological and synthesizing studies indicating how this field has evolved over time. The main objective of this paper is to consolidate the state of the art of research on FW, based on a bibliometrics study of articles published over the past 18 years. The results are discussed under the following perspectives: chronological distribution, countries, institutions, source titles, subject categories, and author keywords. It is found that the FW research has increased rapidly over past 18 years, most notably in the last 8 years. In total, 2340 research articles were published in 801 journals and in 161 WoS subject categories. The top 7 productive countries were analyzed herein. The predominance of Chinese institutions in terms of article count and a predominance of industrialized countries' institutions in terms of citation score were compared. Finally, based on keywords analysis, it comes to the conclusion that the clean energy, treatment and valorization, and management innovation have attracted extensive attention during the past decade. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Evaluative bibliometrics compare the citation impact of researchers, research groups and institutions with each other across time scales and disciplines. Both factors, discipline and period - have an influence on the citation count which is independent of the quality of the publication. Normalizing the citation impact of papers for these two factors started in the mid-1980s. Since then, a range of different methods have been presented for producing normalized citation impact scores. The current study uses a data set of over 50,000 records to test which of the methods so far presented correlate better with the assessment of papers by peers. The peer assessments come from F1000Prime - a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. Of the normalized indicators, the current study involves not only cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized citation score, but also citing-side indicators. As the results show, the correlations of the indicators with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. Since F1000 focuses on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are validated by other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally) based on multi-disciplinary datasets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The faith of the Jesuits was not always in harmony with their scientific research. The Jesuits' worldview changed following the suppression of their Order. Cases from Europe, Russia, and China are highlighted to support the thesis that the unexpected worldwide suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 pushed many Jesuits into new professional arenas where they tried to build their scientific fame. Beijing-based Jesuits were certainly among those who turned to new ways of thinking after their old Society finally lost the Chinese Rites Controversy following the Papal bull of 1742. The Jesuits' political circumstances rapidly deteriorated and the suppression of their Order followed in 1773. A bibliometrical analysis was used to provide statistical insight into the supposed move of Beijing Jesuits from being full-time preachers towards being at least part-time scientists.},

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) exploit past behaviors and user similarities to provide personalized recommendations. There are some precedents of usage in academic environments to assist users finding relevant information, based on assumptions about the characteristics of the items and users. Even if quality has already been taken into account as a property of items in previous works, it has never been given a key role in the re-ranking process for both items and users. In this paper, we present REFORE, a quality-based fuzzy linguistic REcommender system FOr REsearchers. We propose the use of some bibliometric measures as the way to quantify the quality of both items and users without the interaction of experts as well as the use of 2-tuple linguistic approach to describe the linguistic information. The system takes into account the measured quality as the main factor for the re-ranking of the top-N recommendations list in order to point out researchers to the latest and the best papers in their research fileds. To prove the accuracy improvement, we conduct a study involving different recommendation approaches, aiming at measuring their performance gain. The results obtained proved to be satisfactory for the researchers from different departments who took part on the tests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study attempts to undertake bibliometric analysis of the research publications of Gujarat University during the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013. The data for this study was extracted from SCOPUS and included a total of 760 publications that were attributed to authors affiliated to Gujarat University. The publication data was analysed with respect to the type of publications where 83% are journal articles. The paper also analysed the publication trend of Gujarat University and found that from 2008 onwards there was a steady increase in the number of publications. The other aspects that were identified in the paper were the most prolific authors, collaborative authorship patterns and trends, most preferred publications, and so on. The collaboration was found to be the highest in the year 2012 at 0.70 based on the modified collaboration coefficient. The most preferred journal for publication by Gujarat University faculty was ActaPoloniaePharmaceutica-Drug Research and the most cited author of Gujarat University was P.S. Srivastav, while V.K. Jain had the best average citations per paper. © 2015, DESIDOC.},

abstract={Originally, most bibliometric research is aimed at the improvement of library collection-management methods and at the development of new methods for the selection of documents for a collection. This is also true of the impact factor, which was designed to evaluate journals before their inclusion in the collections of research libraries. Thus, the core of bibliometrics is librarianship. However, in recent years bibliometric studies are mainly conducted for the evaluation of scientific developments and individual scientists. In this case, a significant part of such research is carried out by workers at research libraries. Paradoxically, these approaches are not used in librarianship itself. With the expansion of the range of available tools, the development and use of bibliometric methods for the analysis of scientific information in libraries, especially in the acquisition process, once again has become relevant, which is consistent with the changes in science and publishing themselves. This has been stated by both foreign and domestic experts. © 2015, Allerton Press, Inc.},

abstract={In this position paper, we comment on various approaches to the delineation of scientific fields or domains, a typical prerequisite for a wide class of bibliometric studies. There is growing evidence that this meso-level, between micro targets of typical IR and large disciplines handled by macro-level bibliometric studies, takes full advantage of hybrid approaches. Firstly, delineation tasks gain to combine the a priori thinking of traditional IR, which typically involves clearly targeted expectations, and the a posteriori thinking of bibliometric mapping, where the decisions are built on external structuring of the domain in a wider context. The combination of the two ways of thought is far from new, with IR increasingly building on bibliometric networks for query expansion, and bibliometrics building on IR for evaluating and refining its outcomes. Secondly, delineation benefits from the multi-network perspective, which gives different representations of the scientific topics, usually all the more converging than the objects are dense and well separated. Focusing on two basic networks—words and citations—various sequences or combinations of operations are discussed. Bibliometrics and IR, especially when properly combined in multi-network approaches, provide an efficient toolbox for studies of domains delimitation. It should be recalled however that the context of such studies is often loaded with policy stakes that ask for cautious supervision and consultation processes. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. Traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. Central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. Embedded in this database was the Impact Factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the SCI, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. Over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers’ publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. Regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. The h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. Despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. This chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers’ scholarly communication behavior. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

abstract={INTRODUCTION: A deeper understanding of supplementary bibliometrics beyond the impact factor might provide researchers with a better understanding of the citation process. This study presents a multivariate analysis of gastroenterology and hepatology journals to evaluate the predictive ability of seven bibliometrics in the Web of Science to calculate total cites over a 2-year period. METHODS: Coincidentally, bibliometrics appearing during 2008, 2009, and 2010, with their corresponding cites in 2010, 2011, and 2012, were recorded from the Journal Citation Reports Science Edition. A linear mixed-effects design using random slopes and intercepts was performed on 51 out of 74 journals in the Gastroenterology and Hepatology category. RESULT: There was a significant global effect size (R=0.992; P<0.001), which yielded a total variance of 99.2%. The strongest predictors in the model were the Eigenfactor Score and Cited Half-life (P<0.001), followed by the Number of Articles (P=0.011) and the Immediacy Index (P=0.021). The impact factor was not a significant predictor. CONCLUSION: The Eigenfactor Score and Cited Half-life predictors might be the new standards to assess the influence and importance of scientific journals; this approach may help researchers select journals in which to publish their work. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={The overwhelming majority of scientific publications are authored by multiple persons; yet, bibliographic metrics are only assigned to individual articles as single entities. In this paper, we aim at a more fine-grained analysis of scientific authorship. We therefore adapt a text segmentation algorithm to identify potential author changes within the main text of a scientific article, which we obtain by using existing PDF extraction techniques. To capture stylistic changes in the text, we adopt a number of stylometric features. We evaluate our approach on a small subset of PubMed articles consisting of an approximately equal number of research articles written by a varying number of authors. Our results indicate that the more authors an article has the more potential author changes are identified. These results can be considered as an initial step towards a more detailed analysis of scientific authorship, thereby extending the repertoire of bibliometrics.},

abstract={The descriptive and predictive applications of bibliometric methods are used in this paper to identify and describe non-professional interpreting as an emerging specialty within Translation and Interpreting Studies. ‘Collective communication efforts’ are used as a token of scholarly interest on this new area and exploited bibliometrically to build a corpus of relevant publications. Publication count methods are applied to this corpus of 268 scientific works published between 1973 and 2013 in order to shed light on the evolution of this research front, as well as its main features in terms of creation and dissemination of knowledge (authorship, publication types and disciplinary affiliations). Results point to an early apparition of the topic in the early 1970s, but a delayed growth in scholarly production starting in the early 2000s and taking the shape of journal articles and chapters in collective volumes. Research is spearheaded by a small group of scholars with a continuous interest in the issue and complemented by the research activities of ‘one-timers’ from a wide array of disciplines – from Translation and Interpreting Studies to Health Sciences, Psychology and Education – who tend to collaborate, if ever, within their discipline rather than across them. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={How to discover and rank the scientific research team from the huge amount of literatures is a hard challenge for scientific researchers. Therefore, based on social network analysis with bibliometrics, a comprehensive method to discover and rank collaborative research teams is proposed in this paper. With the data from 2010-2015 in CIMS as the sample, of a Chinese journal of CIMS as the samples, n-clique and snow ball sampling method is used to identify collaborative research teams. Then, the research teams are ranked using indexes which include both scientific research outcomes and the close degree of Co-author networks. Case study shows that the method is more comprehensive than the ranking method which considers bibliometrics or network properties only. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Counting citations that a research article received by other articles was the traditional bibliometric method for the evaluation of a scientific research. Citations have been used both to evaluate a scientific paper - usually in conjunction with the peer review methods - and to determine the quality of a scientific research output. The development of tools even more Web 2.0 oriented has profoundly changed the scientific communication process. In this context, many web tools have emerged including the so-called "social media" (e-i., Facebook, Twitter). Hence the need for new indicators to measure the influence of these tools on the scientific community and the emergence of alternative metrics. Altmetrics combines the traditional bibliometrics tool with the use of the web. Formulated with the purpose to measure new aspects of scientific production, these new metrics are placed in order to complement and supplement the existing indicators rather than act as their replacements.},

abstract={This article aims to analyze the theory on the subject of Business Process Management (BPM). To this end, a systematic literature review, whose purpose was to analyze BPM practices, was conducted through the analysis of publications, citations and bibliometrics. The results show the multidisciplinarity of BPM, and how different areas of research address the theme and practice this approach. Among the relevant journals on the topic, the following are highlighted: Business Process Management Journal, Knowlegde and Process Management and Total Quality Management & Business Excellence. Regarding the application approaches, we found that there are three types adopted by the study, and eight practices of BPM were identified. Networks of bibliometrics showed the existence of bibliometric groups that interact very weakly, and the relationship of BPM with the approaches of quality management and reengineering. The increasing number of publications in the area and the existence of several areas of research interested in the topic justify the analysis of the concepts and practices of BPM.},

abstract={We describe ongoing research where the aim is to apply recent results from the research field of information fusion to bibliometric analysis and information retrieval. We highlight the importance of ‘uncertainty’ within information fusion and argue that this concept is crucial also for bibliometrics and information retrieval. More specifically, we elaborate on three research strategies related to uncertainty: uncertainty management methods, explanation of uncertainty and visualization of uncertainty. We exemplify our strategies to the classical problem of author name disambiguation where we show how uncertainty can be modeled explained and visualized using information fusion. We show how an information seeker can benefit from tracing increases/decreases of uncertainty in the reasoning process. We also present how such changes can be explained for the information seeker through visualization techniques, which are employed to highlight the complexity involved in the process of modeling and managing uncertainty in bibliometric analysis. Finally we argue that a further integration of information fusion approaches in the research area of bibliometrics and information retrieval may results in new and fruitful venues of research. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Objectives: A bibliometric analysis of the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) monographs and their related journal articles by: (1) exploring the differences in citations to the HTA monographs in Google Scholar (GS), Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and (2) comparing Scopus citations to the monographs with their related journal articles. Setting: A study of 111 HTA monographs published in 2010 and 2011, and their external journal articles. Main outcome measures: Citations to the monographs in GS, Scopus and WoS, and to their external journal articles in Scopus. Results: The number of citations varied among the three databases, with GS having the highest and WoS the lowest; however, the citation-based rankings among the databases were highly correlated. Overall, 56% of monographs had a related publication, with the highest proportion for primary research (76%) and lowest for evidence syntheses (43%). There was a large variation in how the monographs were cited, compared to journal articles, resulting in more frequent problems, with unlinked citations in Scopus and WoS. When comparing differences in the number of citations between monograph publications with their related journal articles from the same project, we found that monographs received more citations than their journal articles for evidence syntheses and methodology projects; by contrast, journal articles related to primary research monographs were more highly cited than their monograph. Conclusions: The numbers of citations to the HTA monographs differed considerably between the databases, but were highly correlated. When a HTA monograph had a journal article from the same study, there were more citations to the journal article for primary research, but more to the monographs for evidence syntheses. Citations to the related journal articles were more reliably recorded than citations to the HTA monographs.},

abstract={The traditional peer review process for the assessment of scientific performance has been increasingly supported by citation analysis. However, bibliometric methods require the use of appropriate indicators to be meaningfully and significantly. The trend of performing bibliometric analyses by amateurs is most problematic. Seemingly easy to handle tools serve requests of decision makers for impact data and rankings. In this article we plead for the application of professional citation analysis embedded into bibliometric research. For example, journal impact factors are not suitable for measuring the performance of a researcher, because they do not allow conclusions about the impact of single papers published in a specific journal. The h index measures output (number of publications) and impact (number of citations) in one single number and connects both parameters arbitrarily. Instead, percentiles are far better suited for measuring the citation impact of publications and researchers. Using percentiles, publications of researchers and their citations can be visualized as beam plots. Beam plots show at a glance, how productive a researcher has been in a specific year and how often his publications have been cited in relation to comparable publications.},

abstract={The emergence of Google in the field of bibliometrics through personal and collective indicators (researchers and journals) has affected the references of those who rely on impact factors and the counting of citations, particularly within the social sciences and the humanities. Google's lists of the 100 most cited publications in nine different languages, which were updated in 2012 and 2013, allow us to carry out comparative analyses to assess the impact of the Spanish language in the dissemination of science based on the journals' h and h5 indexes. Method: this study is based on the analysis of Google Scholar data, particularly the universal h5index (μ) and the universal h5median (μm), in order to identify the areas of the international dissemination of science in which the impact of the Spanish language is the most and least intense.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To determine the key genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma risk and provide reference information for further study. METHODS: We searched relative articles in Embase, Pubmed and BIOSIS Preview from January 2001 to January 2014. Hepatocellular carcinoma risk genes that were obtained from clinical articles and bioinformatics analyses were selected. RESULTS: Totally 708 articles related to risk of hepatocellular carcinoma were included. Research shows the number of publication paper has been increased significantly in past 3 years. We obtained 201 hepatocellular carcinoma risk genes that were mainly related to immune response, regulation of cellular physiological process, response to external stimulus, inflammatory response, DNA repair, regulation of cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis. A total of 741 functional classifications and 66 pathways were involved when analyzed by the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), respectively. A complex protein-protein network was formed by 189 protein-coding genes with the Online STRING software suggesting the close interaction among these proteins. This network was further visualized and quantified using the Cytoscape software, and 11 key genes from the protein-protein network were determined. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive review on hepatocellular carcinoma risk genes is provided based on the systematic article review and bioinformatics analyses. Various of hepatocellular carcinoma risk genes are identified, which suggests large sample and network analyses are important for future research. ©, 2015, The Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

abstract={This paper consists on a bibliometric analysis of the international influences of the book “Studies on termites from the Mato Grosso State, Brazil”, by AGA Mathews (1977). The number of citations has increased over the years after the first citation. Mathews book was cited in articles, reviews, theses, dissertations, books, book chapters, abstracts in conference proceedings, comments and scientific notes. Most these studies are empirical and descriptive. The studies were conducted in 35 countries of the Neotropical, Palearctic, Afrotropical, Nearctic, Australasia and Indomalaya regions. 55% of the studies were carried out in Brazil. The journals Sociobiology and Insectes Sociaux, have social insect studies within its scope, and the highest number of articles citing Mathews. Most of the 71 authors that cited Mathews more than twice are Brazilian. Constrictotermes cyphergaster was the most studied in over 80% of the studies addressing Isoptera. The most frequent keywords were termite, Isoptera and taxonomy, generalist terms indexed in most publications carried out in different countries. Most of the research studies were carried out in laboratories and native vegetation areas. Studies in agroecosystems were implemented predominantly in Brazil. This study shows the diversity of application (citations) of Mathews’ book, and that the number of citations will continue to increase due to the large amount of information presented by the author. © 2015, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

abstract={The percentile-based rating scale P100 describes the citation impact in terms of the distribution of unique citation values. This approach has recently been refined by considering also the frequency of papers with the same citation counts. Here I compare the resulting P100' with P100 for an empirical dataset and a simple fictitious model dataset. It is shown that P100' is not much different from standard percentile-based ratings in terms of citation frequencies. A new indicator P100″ is introduced. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In the six years since I first researched university research rankings and bibliometrics, much of the world suffered an economic downturn that has impacted research funding and open access journals, research institution repositories and self-published material on the web have opened up access to scholarly output and led to new terminology and output measurements. University rankings have expanded beyond the national end-user consumer market to a research area of global interest for scientometric scholars. Librarians supporting scholarly research have an obligation to understand the background, metrics, sources and the rankings to provide advice to their researchers and their institutions. This chapter updates an article in Taiwan's Evaluation in Higher Education journal (Pagell 2009) based on a presentation at Concert (Pagell 2008). It includes a brief history of scholarly output as a measure of academic achievement. It focuses on the intersection of bibliometrics and university rankings by updating both the literature and the rankings themselves. Librarians should find it relevant and understandable. © 2014 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and the Author(s).},

abstract={Background. Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h- and c-indices. Changes in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated. © 2014 Patricia M. Davidson et al.},

abstract={We searched and retrieved literature on the topic of medical image processing published on SCI journals in the past 10 years. We then imported the retrieved literature into TDA for data cleanup before data analysis and pro cessing by EXCLE and UCINET to generate tables and figures that could indicate disciplinary correlation and research hotspots from the perspective of bibliometrics. The results indicated that people in Europe and USA were leading researchers on medical image processing with close international cooperation. Many disciplines contributed to the fast development of medical image processing with intense interdisciplinary researches. The papers that we found show recent research hotspots of the algorithm, system, model, image and segmentation in the field of medical image processing. Cluster analysis on key words of high frequency demonstrated complicated clustering relationship.},

abstract={Quality in Higher Education Institutions is the subject of several debates in the academic community in a worldwide basis and various efforts are made towards identifying ways to quantify it. In this respect, the use of bibliometrics gains significant ground as an effective tool for the evaluation of universities' research output. In the present study, the research performance of the seven Greek medical schools is assessed by means of widely accepted and advanced bibliometric indices, such as total and average publications and citations, average and median h- and g-index with and without self-citations for all the 1,803 academics, while statistical analysis of the data was also performed in order to compare the observed differences in the mean values of the calculated indices. Considerable effort was exerted to overcome all inherent limitations of a bibliometric analysis through a meticulous data collection. This large-scale work was conducted both in school and academic rank level leading to interesting results concerning the scientific activity of the medical schools studied as units and of the various academic ranks separately, which can be partially justified with geographic and socioeconomic criteria. In general, bibliometrics demonstrate statistically significant difference in favour of Crete University medical school, while it was also found that self-citations have only marginal effect on the individual's research profile and the average indices. Finally, the useful findings of the present study render the methodology adopted of high viability for assessing the research performance of Higher Education Institutions even in a broader context. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Objective The relationship between metrics, such as the h-index, and the ability of researchers to generate funding has not been previously investigated in neurosurgery. This study was performed to determine whether a correlation exists between bibliometrics and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding data among academic neurosurgeons. Methods The h-index, m-quotient, g-index, and contemporary h-index were determined for 1225 academic neurosurgeons from 99 (of 101) departments. Two databases were used to create the citation profiles, Google Scholar and Scopus. The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports tool was accessed to obtain career grant funding amount, grant number, year of first grant award, and calendar year of grant funding. Results Of the 1225 academic neurosurgeons, 182 (15%) had at least 1 grant with a fully reported NIH award profile. Bibliometric indices were all significantly higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without NIH funding (P <.001). The contemporary h-index was found to be significantly predictive of NIH funding (P <.001). All bibliometric indices were significantly associated with the total number of grants, total award amount, year of first grant, and duration of grants in calendar years (bivariate correlation, P <.001) except for the association of m-quotient with year of first grant (P =.184). Conclusions Bibliometric indices are higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without, but only the contemporary h-index was shown to be predictive of NIH funding. Among neurosurgeons with NIH funding, higher bibliometric scores were associated with greater total amount of funding, number of grants, duration of grants, and earlier acquisition of their first grant.},

abstract={These days, we are seeing increasing demand for accurate measurement of the effectiveness of policies. However, it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of policies accurately, because of the limited number of methods, which include interviews, analysis based on the number of patents, and analysis of theses. Therefore, there is increasing demand fora methodology for precise measurement. Through this research, we would like to be part of those researches trying to satisfy this demand by adopting biblio metric analysis. In this paper, we introduced network analysis in order to evaluate a country'spresence in the academic field. In particular, we focused on three centralities, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and closeness centrality, in the measurement. As a result, it is shown that Singaporean institutes have higher centrality, especially betweenness centrality, as well as a high ratio of international researchers. © 2014 IEEE.},

It was found that 39 kinds of diseases and symptoms, mainly nerve system disedses, could be treated with acupuncture at Shenmen (HT 7), including insomnia, depression, anxiety and dementia. Shenmen (HT 7) was seldom used alone. Instead, it was commonly used along with Baihui (GV 20), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Neiguan (PC 6), Sishencong (EX-HN 1) and Taicong (LR 3).},

abstract={Biomedical research has grown considerably in the last few decades, and the authorship characteristics of the dental literature as a whole and of its specialty fields has changed significantly. Unfortunately, the bibliometrics of the periodontal literature have not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the bibliometrics of periodontal literature, assessing the geographic origin, study design, and topics investigated in periodontal research published from 1995 to 2010. Methods: Articles published in periodontal journals during 1995 to 2010 were retrieved through hand search. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied. The following variables were extrapolated from each article: number of authors, study design, topic investigated, financial support, and geographic origin. The general linear model assessed the influence of independent variables on number of authors per article, and χ2 test assessed the statistical difference of the variables over years 1995 to 2010. Results: A total of 2,260 articles were reviewed; 2,076 met the inclusion criteria. The number of authors per article increased (P &lt;0.001) from 4.0 (1995) to 5.1 (2010). The proportion of articles published from North America and Europe decreased (P &lt;0.001) from 84.3% (1995) to 58.6% (2010), whereas for Asia and South America the article proportion increased (P &lt;0.001) from 13.8% (1995) to 40% (2010). Research targeting prevention and treatment of periodontal disease is decreasing (P &lt;0.001) in favor of implant-related research. Governmental research funding is increasing (P &lt;0.001). Conclusion: Periodontal research significantly changed during the last 15 years.},

abstract={Research assessment is a hot topic in academic debate, as in the immediate future research will become more and more dependent on assessment procedures - i.e. peer review process (qualitative method) and bibliometrics (quantitative method) - for the allocation of public funds. Since bibliometric indicators have been originally developed for hard sciences, they don't fit for humanities. Therefore librarians should rediscover their bibliometric skills - originally developed within libraries - to support the profession. The article insists on the connection between library science and bibliometrics, and on the role that librarians could play in research assessment: seen in this light, bibliometrics is an opportunity to lead the profession beyond the boundary of the traditional library services.},

abstract={The research on indications of acu-moxibustion is very important for effectively guiding clinical practice. In the present paper, the authors retrieved domestic literature about researches on the disease-spectrum or indications of acu-moxibustion therapy in recent 10 years, and made a bibliometrics analysis according to the described research methods, publishing year, quantity and their proportionate relationship. A total of 18 qualified original papers involving 414 illnesses or clinical conditions were included in the present paper. Among the 414 kinds of clinical conditions or illnesses, 72 were considered to be suitable candidates for acu-moxibustion therapy, including functional dyspepsia, herpes zoster, irritable bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal dysfunction, scapulohumeral periarthritis, cervical syndrome, dyssomnia, acne (cyst type), chronic urticaria, regional neurodermatitis, pain, itching, etc. which belong to illness-spectrum grade-I. Generally, the acu-moxibustion therapy is, in clinical effects, relatively poorer for structural diseases which are attributed to grade-II or grade-III type. Nevertheless, the diversity of clinical indications of acu-moxibustion has been confirmed nowadays. Current studies on illness-spectrum are of certain uniformity and comprehensiveness, but need further extending and perfecting, and need more standardized methods corresponding to principles of the evidence-based medicine.},

abstract={Seemingly endless new technologies are emerging. Mapping out Science and Technology (S&T) planning correctly on the national level would help innovation shareholders remain current on technological development trends and gain an advantageous position among the fierce future competition of the global market. Thus, formulating effective S&T planning is significant for a nation, especially for new and emerging technologies. This paper proposes an industry S&T planning framework. Different from previous frameworks, this methodology's dynamic is directed in four dimensions (nation, technology, industry, risks and impacts), tries to find the key elements in a specific technology area, and aims to aid in national S&T planning. China's solar cell industry is employed as the case study. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: To analyze the performance and quality of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) publications identified in medical databases during a recent period in terms of bibliographic metrics.
Materials and methods: A bibliometric search was conducted for IORT papers published in the PubMed database between 1997 and 2013. Publication rate was used as a quantity indicator; the 2012 Science Citation Index Impact Factor as a quality indicator. Furthermore, the publications were stratified in terms of study type, scientific topic reported, year of publication, tumor type and journal specialty. We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine differences between the means of the analyzed groups.
Results: Among the total of 207 journals, articles were reported significantly more frequently in surgery (n = 399, 41 %) and radiotherapy journals (n = 273, 28 %; p < 0.01). The highest impact factor was achieved by clinical oncology journals (p < 0.01). The majority of identified articles were retrospective cohort reports (n = 622, 64 %), followed by review articles (n = 204, 21 %; p < 0.001). Regarding primary topic, reports on cancer outcome following specific tumor therapy were most frequently published (n = 661, 68 %; p < 0.001) and gained the highest mean impact factor (p < 0.01). Gastrointestinal tumor reports were represented most frequently (n = 456, 47 %; p < 0.001) and the mean superior impact factor was earned by breast and gynecologic publications (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: We identified a consistent and sustained scientific productivity of international IORT expert groups. Most publications appeared in journals with surgical and radiooncological content. The highest impact factor was achieved by medical oncology journals. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Objective: This paper describes the production of bibliometric studies in Catalonia in quantitative terms. It examines publications that use bibliometric tools to determine features of scientific production but excludes journals that present or discuss bibliometric methods and techniques. Methodology: Bibliometric tools were used to analyse the registers of a relational database obtained from various sources, including the bibliographic databases of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA), Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA), and the index Library Literature and Information Science. Searches were also performed using PubMed, Dialnet, and Google Scholar, and references were obtained by citation chaining. Results: A total of 297 documents were identified, of which 76.8%were journal articles. These examined a substantial number of knowledge areas, of which biomedicine was especially prominent. The subject matter of the documents ranged across the spectrum of the knowledge areas analysed. In general, the studies that predominated addressed Spain, although there were variations that also responded to this range of areas. The predominant language was Spanish, most papers were co-authored by two or more authors and the most common author arrangement was a collaboration between departmental members.},

abstract={This paper introduces author-level bibliometric co-occurrence network by discussing its history and contribution to the analysis of scholarly communication and intellectual structure. The difference among various author co-occurrence networks, which type of network shall be adapted in different situations, as well as the relationship among these networks, however, remain not explored. Five types of author co-occurrence networks were proposed: (1) co-authorship (CA); (2) author co-citation (ACC); (3) author bibliographic coupling (ABC); (4) words-based author coupling (WAC); (5) journals-based author coupling (JAC). Networks of 98 high impact authors from 30 journals indexed by 2011 version of Journal Citation Report-SSCI under the Information Science & Library Science category are constructed for study. Social network analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis are applied to identify sub-networks with results visualized by VOSviewer software. QAP test is used to find potential correlation among networks. Cluster analysis results show that all the five types of networks have the power for revealing intellectual structure of sciences but the revealed structures are different from each other. ABC identified more sub-structures than other types of network, followed by CA and ACC. WAC result is easily affected and JAC result is ambiguous. QAP test result shows that ABC network has the highest proximity with other types of networks while CA network has relatively lower proximity with other networks. This paper will provide a better comprehension of author interaction and contribute to cognitive application of author co-occurrence network analysis. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={We performed a comprehensively bibliometric analysis of 4420 published articles of Acta Geographica Sinica during 1934- 2013, with the perspectives of growth trends, key words, article authors and research institutions. Moreover, we analyzed the main affiliated branches, including physical geography, human geography and geographical techniques based on geographic trichotomy and the general geography. This paper aims at investigating the development trend and characteristics of Acta Geographica Sinica, a journal that represents the highest academic level in the field of geography in China. The results show that: a) Acta Geographica Sinica has reflected the latest research achievements of China's highest academic level in the field of geography to a large extent. b) The number of Acta Geographica Sinica yearly publications varies significantly, which is in accordance with important events of China. c) Although Acta Geographica Sinica is a comprehensive periodical, most of its publications are focused on physical geography. d) Acta Geographica Sinica has a stable group of academic and research scholars, thus there is a demand of new academic leaders. e) Acta Geographica Sinica has relatively high agglomeration effects and the research objects and contents of geography research in China are significantly concerned to special regions. ©, 2014, Science Press.

abstract={Along with the growth of scientific production, the bibliometric studies have become essential, providing relevant information about any domain while identifying, highlighting and viewing the scientific knowledge constructed within a theme, subject or knowledge area. This article approaches the bibliometric studies under the light of metatheory and domain analysis within the knowledge organization in information science, domain analysis and metatheory are considered significant contribution to bibliometric studies when emphasizing the need for epistemological, sociological and historical analyzes, as well as other qualitative approaches, encouraging researchers to reflect on the whole composition of the research object, by means of different methodological, theoretical and epistemological approaches. This study aims at contributing to the discourse of the theoretical aspects of bibliometric studies by presenting considerations concerning Hjørland's domain analysis, as well as Ritzer's metatheoretical approach, featuring discussions on major theories of a study field, since these approaches together provide a more complete qualitative view upon an area, here, represented by the bibliometric studies.},

abstract={Water quality deterioration as a consequence of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution or diffuse pollution has been documented around the world (Davis and Koop 2006; Ma et al. 2011; Novotny 1999; Smith 2003). This deterioration not only damages the social and ecological functions of water bodies as water supply, fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, and recreation (Pretty et al. 2003), but also largely raises water treatment and policy response costs (Novotny 1999; Pretty et al. 2003). Understanding and evaluating the processes of pollution generation, transport, and transformation are continuous challenges for scientists and engineers. Modeling as a way to simplify the complex natural processes has been widely used in NPS pollution research (Zhuang et al. 2012). There are various NPS pollution models available now, which were summarized and compared in different previous studies (Alexander et al. 2002; Borah and Bera 2003; Shen et al. 2012). These reviews of available models are meaningful, though they hardly provide a direct overview of worldwide research efforts and the general trends in NPS pollution modeling. Since researchers have conducted research in this field for several decades, a comprehensive and quantitative review of past efforts, including influencing researchers and their performance, participating regions and their activity, and general shift of key issues, will provide an informed perspective on future research. Bibliometrics, which utilizes visual and quantitative analysis to summarize trends in selected research fields (Pritchard 1969), can reveal research patterns of certain field, such as publication output, author performance, geographical distribution of publications, scientific cooperation, and temporal variation of hot issues (Liu et al. 2011; Zhuang et al. 2012). The quantitative and visual characteristics of bibliometric analysis are important supplements to traditional literature reviews. This paper presents worldwide performance and trends in NPS pollution modeling from 1994 to 2013 based on bibliometric methods. © 2014 Soil and Water Conservation Society.},

abstract={In a bid for an eye-catching title, many writers use devices such as interrogation and exclamation marks, metaphors, double meanings and vague expressions which do not comply with accepted standards in style manuals of scientific writing. The purpose of this article is to analyse the lack of accuracy of titles in articles on bibliometrics published in biomedical journals and to discuss the effect this may have on the reader. A corpus of 1,505 titles included in PubMed and Web of Science between 2009 and 2011 and retrieved under the MeSH major topic “bibliometrics” and other related terms was analyzed. Different types of inaccuracy were identified and a classification was developed and used for this particular study. 23.4 % of the titles contain inaccuracies of some kind. Editorial titles show a higher percentage of these (11.43 %) than original articles (8.83 %) and letters (3.2 %), the most frequent being the inclusion of a question in the title (seen in 30.9 % of the papers), followed by vague and imprecise expressions (17.8 %), acronyms (16.4 %) and double meanings (14 %). Many titles fail to comply with the conventions of scientific writing. A descriptive title accurately reflecting the content of an article would give readers a better idea of its content, help them to decide more rapidly whether they want to read it and facilitate retrieval from bibliographic databases. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={The debate on research assessment in Italy has intensified after ANVUR's (National agency for the assessment of the University system and research) proposition to create a bibliometric database for the humanities and social sciences (HSS). The article highlights the limits of ANVUR's proposal by presenting a brief review of HSS research and professional communities' responses, and points out the possible benefits of such a database particularly in terms of international visibility. Since research assessment is a multidimensional process, bibliometrics can complement qualitative methods for the evaluation of research produced in Italy by humanists and social scientists. However, a more rigorous methodological approach is needed in order to take account of the epistemological diversities of the research communities in HSS.},

abstract={Objectives: Unhealthy lifestyles and exercise deficit disorders negatively impact societies in general, as well as individuals’ health, social, cultural, and physical status and in respect to this matter childhood is a very sensitive period. Summarizing the research focused in children’s physical exercise behaviour and consequently in their bodies growth, development, and muscle compositions may provide a snapshot of this field for the experts dealing with children. Methods: In relation to the muscle composition, sport is of significant importance and the aim of this paper is to quantitatively analyse the research literature from this area by using bibliometric analysis. Results: The production of papers was clearly increasing, however it was published by many different researchers coming from more than 170 institutions, 29 countries, and the research was published in 70 different journals. The research papers became shorter but on the other hand there were positive trends in the number of references, number of authors, number of institutions and countries per paper. Conclusions: This analysis revealed that research in the field of childrens’ muscle compositions related to sport is increasing; however it is highly dispersed and incoherent; the number of authors and references per paper are increasing, the average age of references is decreasing and the papers’ production is becoming more international, additionally bibliometrics proved to be a useful tool for those who need a quick overview of research and its utilisation, and as a starting point for integrative literature reviews and more exhaustive data, information, and knowledge seeking. © 2014, Sport Science.

abstract={As the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention (in science policy) over the past few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric studies have been published dealing with excellent papers. However, many different methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers. The present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an 'average' or 'most frequent' bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science yielded 321 papers dealing with 'highly cited', 'most cited', 'top cited', and 'most frequently cited'. Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study. In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided to identify excellent papers. With definitions that relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers (58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Approximately 23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top 10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be possible to identify excellent papers based on an 'average' or 'most frequent' practice among bibliometricians.© The Author 2014.

abstract={Bibliometrics as the application of mathematical and statistical methods to books and other media of communication research [1] has already been established since a couple of years as a basis for funding decisions, and as an accepted instrument for evaluation of persons and institutions or recognizing trends and tendencies in science and technology. A wide range of methods and indicators are used to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present a new bibliometric indicator - the SIP Score - which is an adoption of the Influence Passivity Score (invented for the microblogging platform Twitter). We explain the adoption process, show the first results on a special created bibliographical dataset and discuss comparison approaches with 'classical' indicators (h-index and its derivate).

abstract={Nurse scientists commonly weigh the impact oftheir work on the discipline ofnursing as well as within the larger healthcare arena. Bibliometrics, a statistical method used in citation and content analysis, is a quantitative approach for calculating output and for analyzing value and merit ofscientific output. Bibliometric mapping is a method for visually representing bibliometric data. A synthesis between creative design and information visualization, bibliometric mapping highlights the impact ofgiven research on a discipline and has the potential to foster increased data comprehension. Widely used in the field ofinformation science, bibliometrics has received less attention in nursing and healthcare. This paper describes the methodological considerations for bibliometrics, software that could be considered for citation analyses, and an exemplar that shows the visual richness ofbibliometric mapping. Recommendations are made for facilitating bibliometric analyses.},

abstract={Bibliometric analysis is very useful in evaluating the trends in research capacity. Its recent applications include spotting emerging technology trends and also to support the development of technology roadmaps. The exploratory research in this paper aims to match the market, products as well as research on emerging technologies through the use of bibliometrics. The emerging frameworks on the use of bibliometrics for technology roadmapping are complemented by developing a framework that determines the future industrial impact of emerging technologies. The proposed framework is used to determine the nanotechnology impact on selected manufacturing industries. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Continuing a previous theoretical research in bibliometrics, this study aims to conclude a bibliometric endeavor, in the quest of finding an adapted impact measure for scientific papers. Its main objective is to define a technological solution capable to interpret both citations and papers' content, in an integrative approach. The solution employs natural language processors, similarity measures and graph computation algorithms, while integrating them in a software prototype. Describing the design and implementation phases, the research underlines specific solutions and optimizations for relevance computing in citation networks.},

abstract={Although the research and application of a geographic information system (GIS) in bibliometrics remains in its initial stage, several valuable attempts have been made in recent years. This paper provides our overview regarding this area. We first reviewed the spatial information mining derived from literature, including structured and unstructured data. The spatial display and the basic spatial operations for the geographic information derived from literature were then introduced, demonstrating that GIS can be directly used to construct digital libraries. Some literature database websites have begun to utilize WEBGIS to display the spatial distribution of an author's location. Additionally, the spatial distribution information can be displayed in various modes with other specialized tools. Potential spatial analyses in bibliometrics were then discussed, introducing geostatistical and buffer analyses as case studies. Finally, several bibliometric indicators attached with research units were investigated. When the quantitative research index units are linked with the research spatial position, they can be displayed, queried and retrieved spatially. Future work to advance the application and research of GIS in bibliometrics is still warranted. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Experts have more difficulty identifying reverse salients in R&D because of increasing technological complexity and a shortened technology lifecycle. As an alternative, we suggest a new and systematic method of identifying and forecasting reverse salients using QFD (quality function deployment), bibliometric analysis, and TIA (trend impact analysis). QFD allows users to systematically identify and prioritize reverse salients. An integration of QFD, bibliometric analysis, and TIA makes it possible to specify key performance indicators of reverse salient in order to identify the performance gap between current and market-required performance and to make a probabilistic forecast about when reverse salients will be corrected. Our method will help managers identify a top priority reverse salient, forecast its future, and thus make better R&D decisions with regard to market requirements. A carbon nanotube biosensor technology is used as an example. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this work is to discuss distribution of Chinese medical syndrome for anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) by modern literature research, in order to provide guilds and methodological references for establishing a series of scientific and rational systems for distribution of Chinese medical syndrome in anovulatory DUB. Bibliometric analysis was used in this study. The modern literatures had been retrieved, and the study subjects were modern literatures involving the classification of distribution of Chinese medical syndrome in DUB, from 1989 to 2013. In the end, totally 16 qualified articles were incorporated. The number of cases was 1249, the frequencies of syndrome occurrence were 55. The general information, the frequency of syndrome occurrence and the number of cases in literatures were analyzed. Finally, syndrome denomination database was established. The result showed that the syndrome differentiations of anovulatory DUB were mainly the intrinsic blood heat, blood stasis obstructing the uterus, kidney-yin deficiency, qi deficiency failing to control blood, kidney-yang deficiency. However, the other syndrome differentiation research gave priority to visceral pattern identification and qi-blood pattern identification. Therefore, we conclude that syndrome distributions of anovulatory DUB are mainly visceral pattern identification and qi-blood pattern identification. Moreover, the disease pathogenesis of traditional Chinese medicine closely related to qi and blood, spleen and kidney disease pathogenesis. So this disease can be treated by the theory of "invigorating the spleen". The study attempts to provide the theory for distribution of Chinese medical syndrome in anovulatory DUB, at the same time provide a demonstration for the similar study of other diseases. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Systematic reviews are important for informing clinical practice and health policy. The aim of this study was to examine the bibliometrics of systematic reviews and to determine the amount of variance in citations predicted by the journal impact factor (JIF) alone and combined with several other characteristics. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,261 systematic reviews published in 2008 and the citations to them in the Scopus database from 2008 to June 2012. Potential predictors of the citation impact of the reviews were examined using descriptive, univariate and multiple regression analysis. The mean number of citations per review over four years was 26.5 (SD ± 29.9) or 6.6 citations per review per year. The mean JIF of the journals in which the reviews were published was 4.3 (SD ± 4.2). We found that 17% of the reviews accounted for 50% of the total citations and 1.6% of the reviews were not cited. The number of authors was correlated with the number of citations (r = 0.215, P < 0.001). Higher numbers of citations were associated with the following characteristics: first author from the United States (36.5 citations), an ICD-10 chapter heading of Neoplasms (31.8 citations), type of intervention classified as Investigation, Diagnostics or Screening (34.7 citations) and having an international collaboration (32.1 citations). The JIF alone explained more than half of the variation in citations (R(2) = 0.59) in univariate analysis. Adjusting for both JIF and type of intervention increased the R2 value to 0.81. Fourteen percent of reviews published in the top quartile of JIFs (≥ 5.16) received citations in the bottom quartile (eight or fewer), whereas 9% of reviews published in the lowest JIF quartile (≤ 2.06) received citations in the top quartile (34 or more). Six percent of reviews in journals with no JIF were also in the first quartile of citations. The JIF predicted over half of the variation in citations to the systematic reviews. However, the distribution of citations was markedly skewed. Some reviews in journals with low JIFs were well-cited and others in higher JIF journals received relatively few citations; hence the JIF did not accurately represent the number of citations to individual systematic reviews.},

abstract={This paper introduces bibliometrics co-occurrence at author-level by discussing its history and contribution to the analysis of scholarly communication and intellectual structure. It proposes five types of bibliometrics co-occurrence networks at author-level: (1) Coauthorship (CA); (2) Author Co-citation (ACC); (3) Author Bibliographic Coupling (ABC); (4) Words-based Author Coupling (WAC); (5) Journals-based Author Coupling (JAC). Networks of 98 highly influential authors from 18 journals indexed by 2011 version of journal Citation Report-SSCI under the Information Science & Library Science (IS&LS) category are constructed for study. Social Network Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis are applied as methods for identifying sub-networks with results visualized by VOSViewer. QAP test is used to find potential correlation among networks. The results from cluster analysis show that all the five types of networks have the power for revealing intellectual structure of sciences but have differences in describing results. Through the structure analysis of each type, the research groups which have relatively less connections with others are easily identified. ABC identified more substructures than other types of network, followed by CA and ACC while the result from WAC is easily affected. Analyzing result from JAC is ambiguous. QAP test result shows that ABC network has the highest proximity with networks of other types while CA network has relatively lower proximity with other networks. A combined use of several methods is suggested to have a better analysis of revealing intellectual structure of sciences. © AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH Vienna 2013.},

Here I advocate and demonstrate adaption of the h-index and the g-index to the top video content creators on YouTube. The h-index for Internet video media is based on videos and their view counts. The h-index is defined as the number of videos with ≥h × 105 views. The g-index is defined as the number of videos with ≥g × 105 views on average. When compared with a video creator's total view count, the h-index and g-index better capture both productivity and impact in a single metric. © 2013 ASIS&amp;T.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether news media as a form of social communication regarding pressing, important, and contemporary issues could be used as a leading indicator of technology adoption. For technology foresight, monitoring and analyzing energy technologies is in the spotlight due to their strategic importance to the agenda of competitive and sustainable economic growth. Design/methodology/approach: The trends in renewable energy production and news media are determined and compared to draw inferences in foresight concerning the use of renewable energy technologies in energy production. Consequently, the data concern wind and solar energy production and their representation in news media in Germany and the UK. The analysis proceeds as a quasi-experiment treating each yearly observation of energy production as a function of news media data with lagged variables. Findings: The study reveals consistent dynamics in the lag in the primary production of energy in related technologies compared to the media visibility of the respective technologies. Originality/value: This study explores the prospects of using news media data in foresight analysis concerning renewable energy production and provides many fruitful avenues for foresight research in investigating relationships between technology adoption and media exposure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The ability of metrics to represent complex information about research in an accessible format has previously been overlooked in preference to debate about their shortcomings as research evaluation tools. Here, we argue that bibliometrics have the potential to widen scientific participation by allowing non-academic stakeholders to access scientific decision making, thereby increasing the democratisation of science. Government policies from 3 countries (UK, Australia and Spain) are reviewed. Each country outlines a commitment to the democratisation of science for one set of policies whilst ignoring this commitment when developing parallel research evaluation policies. We propose a change in dialogue from whether bibliometrics should be used to how they should be used in future evaluations. Future research policies should take advantage of bibliometrics to foster greater democratisation of research to create more socially-reflexive evaluation systems. © The Author 2013.

abstract={Science has recently been accelerating at a fast rate, resulting in what has been called "information overload" and more recently "filter failure". In this perspective, journal performance indicators can play an important role in journal evaluation. Opinions on the appropriate use of journal-level bibliometrics indicators can be divided but they have now long been used as measures in research evaluation, and many editors see it as part of their editorial duty to try and improve bibliometrics indicators and rankings for their journal. There are various techniques through which this can be attempted, some more ethical than others. Some editors may try to boost the bibliometrics performance of their journals through gratuitous citations. This is problematic because citations are meant to provide useful references, scientifically justifiable, to previously published literature. As such citations can be used as widely accepted measures of scientific impact. Therefore, superfluous citations can distort the validity of bibliometrics indicators. It might be tempting to try to improve a journal's bibliometrics rankings at all costs, but these are only as meaningful as the data that feed into them. Exceedingly inflated indicators due to unethical behaviours can damage the reputation of a journal and its editors, and can lead to a loss of quality manuscript submissions, which in turn is likely to affect the journal's future citation impact. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={One of the most significant inaccuracies of bibliometric databases is that of omitted citations, namely, missing electronic links between a paper of interest and some citing papers, which are (or should be) covered by the database. This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating a database's omitted-citation rate, based on the combined use of 2 or more bibliometric databases. A statistical model is also presented for (a) estimating the "true" number of citations received by individual papers or sets of papers, and (b) defining an appropriate confidence interval. The proposed approach could represent a first step towards the definition of a standard for evaluating the accuracy level of databases. © 2013 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Pharmacology/pharmacy is an important scientific field and plays a pivotal role in new drug research and development. China has steadily increased investment in drug development. This study aimed to evaluate the productivity of China in the field pharmacology/pharmacy in the past decade in relation to ten representative countries. The publications in the field pharmacology/pharmacy of China and ten representative countries in the past decade (2001-2010) were retrieved from Web of Science database, and studies were conducted on the immediacy index of articles published in 2011. Multiple bibliometric indicators were obtained from the "InCites" analysis. Most of the bibliometric indicators for the developed countries including the USA and the European countries remained stable in the past decade. The number of publications by the Asian countries, especially China, increased dramatically in the past decade year by year; however, the Asian countries improved little in the indicators assessing the scientific quality of publications including the citation behaviors and the impact relative to either country and subject area. It may need a long time to fill in the gap, in terms of the scientific quality, between the developing countries and the developed countries. In view of the dramatic increase in the financial investment, our findings suggest that the development of the field pharmacology/pharmacy worldwide is not optimistic, which may partially explain the decreased R&D productivity of pharmaceutical industry since the last decade. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

We observed that there are clear differences in the number and interdisciplinary spread of competencies across regions: the USA retains the largest capacity and capability for pursuing medical and pharmaceutical applications; China has shown substantial growth through fusion approaches with chemistry and material sciences; Japan has been pursuing basic biology and is currently seeking further growth; and the UK has shown considerable growth and quality with a focus on medical research and the widest interdisciplinary spread. Furthermore, we discuss policy implications from these results in terms of industrial and clinical applications.

abstract={Given the importance of cross-disciplinary research (CDR), facilitating CDR effectiveness is a priority for many institutions and funding agencies. There are a number of CDR types, however, and the effectiveness of facilitation efforts will require sensitivity to that diversity. This article presents a method characterizing a spectrum of CDR designed to inform facilitation efforts that relies on bibliometric techniques and citation data. We illustrate its use by the Toolbox Project, an ongoing effort to enhance cross-disciplinary communication in CDR teams through structured, philosophical dialogue about research assumptions in a workshop setting. Toolbox Project workshops have been conducted with more than 85 research teams, but the project's extensibility to an objectively characterized range of CDR collaborations has not been examined. To guide wider application of the Toolbox Project, we have developed a method that uses multivariate statistical analyses of transformed citation proportions from published manuscripts to identify candidate areas of CDR, and then overlays information from previous Toolbox participant groups on these areas to determine candidate areas for future application. The approach supplies 3 results of general interest: A way to employ small data sets and familiar statistical techniques to characterize CDR spectra as a guide to scholarship on CDR patterns and trends. A model for using bibliometric techniques to guide broadly applicable interventions similar to the Toolbox.

abstract={In their sustainable practices strategies, companies try to improve their production processes, products and management of the products end of life and their residues. And one of the strategies adopted by organizations is ecodesign. The adoption of ecodesign considers the impacts on the environment in all organization's decisions, considering the same degree of importance given to, for example, profit, quality, aesthetics or ergonomics of the product. The aimed this paper is to conduct a literature study in a structured manner on the subject ecodesign. For this, a three-stage methodology (Planning, Implementation and Reporting) was used. It was considered in planning: research purpose definition and data source identification; time interval used; Criteria for database selection; base tests and; publication type definition. The implementation consists of all the steps from searching databases and use of the criteria to arrive to a final sample of 132 articles that deal with this topic. The reporting is about bibliometric analysis performed on articles. With all these proposed procedures, it is intended, in the end, to demonstrate ways for the researcher to address the issue that he wishes, in this case the ecodesign and also to help identify gaps not yet explored this topic.},

abstract={This paper correlates the peer evaluations performed in late 2009 by the disciplinary committees of CNPq (a Brazilian funding agency) with some standard bibliometric measures for 55 scientific areas. We compared the decisions to increase, maintain or decrease a scientist's research scholarship funded by CNPq. We analyzed these decisions for 2,663 Brazilian scientists and computed their correlations (Spearman rho) with 21 different measures, among them: total production, production in the last 5 years, production indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, total citations received (according to WOS, Scopus, and Google Scholar), h-index and m-quotient (according to the three citation services). The highest correlations for each area range from 0.95 to 0.29, although there are areas with no significantly positive correlation with any of the metrics. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={It is hoped that the knowledge produced by scientific research turns into concrete benefits (material or non-material). Bibliometrics, with its various indexes, became the reference of scientific evaluation as an "objective" measure of scientific impact. In Brazil, the evaluation system focused on CAPES has been of great importance for the development of postgraduate studies and research; however changes are necessary, among others, to its bibliometric approach. If we consider the area of health, the challenge of the Unified Health System (SUS) implies the search for scientifically sound alternatives, regarding questions ranging from diagnosis, cure and prevention of a variety of problems, to the organization of a macro-structure capable of giving broad and equal access to the resources required for improving the health of the population. The solutions require expertise and creativity on the part of the researchers and the expected products must include, but are not limited to scientific publications.},

abstract={It is hoped that the knowledge produced by scientific research turns into concrete benefits (material or non-material). Bibliometrics, with its various indexes, became the reference of scientific evaluation as an "objective" measure of scientific impact. In Brazil, the evaluation system focused on CAPES has been of great importance for the development of postgraduate studies and research; however changes are necessary, among others, to its bibliometric approach. If we consider the area of health, the challenge of the Unified Health System (SUS) implies the search for scientifically sound alternatives, regarding questions ranging from diagnosis, cure and prevention of a variety of problems, to the organization of a macro-structure capable of giving broad and equal access to the resources required for improving the health of the population. The solutions require expertise and creativity on the part of the researchers and the expected products must include, but are not limited to scientific publications.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to conduct a bibliometric and taxonomy-based analysis of the field of CSCW to map its recent evolution at a quantitative and qualitative level. A model for semantic analytics and social evaluation is also discussed with emphasis on the hypothesis of putting crowds into the loop of bibliography classification process to improve the current labor-intensive, time-consuming, unrepeatable and sometimes subjective task of scientometricians. A total of 1,480 publications were carefully reviewed and subjected to scientometric data analysis methods and techniques. Analyzed parameters included document orientation, deviation from trend in the total number of citations, and publication activity by author's affiliation country. A semantic classification of 541 publications allows identifying growing trends and lacking research indicators. At a human-centered perspective, limitations are unfilled in the limitative analytical spectrum, laborious and time-consuming processes of data seeking, gathering, cataloguing and analysis, subjective results at a taxonomic level, lack of more bibliographic data analytics perspectives, and absence of human-centered results concerning cognitive aspects in meta-knowledge research practices. Hypotheses are suggested towards a crowd-enabled model for bibliography evaluation in order to understand the ways as humans and machines can work cooperatively and massively on scientific data to solve complex problems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Text mining has being increasingly used to automate the process of extracting the relevant information contained in biomedical texts, enabling researchers to stay abreast of the development of biomedicine. Taking into account the importance of this research field, this paper presents a map of scientific publications on biomedical text mining and discusses the main activities in this field in which the researchers have devoted attention. Thus, we used bibliometrics, a technique that allows us to analyze the development of a field of science to identify its characteristics. The mapping presented promotes knowledge about the history and current state of the research field. Also, it provides inputs aiming to enrich the discussion on possible directions that researches in the area have taken as well as likely scientific trends for researchers and interested in the subject.},

abstract={Developments in network technologies, scholarly communication, and national policy are challenging academic libraries to find new ways to engage with research communities in the economic downturn. Librarians are responding with service innovations in areas such as bibliometrics and research data management. Previous surveys have investigated research data support within North America and other research services globally with small samples. An online multiple-choice questionnaire was used to survey bibliometric and data support activities of 140 libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, including current and planned services, target audiences, service constraints, and staff training needs. A majority of respondents offered or planned bibliometrics training, citation reports, and impact calculations but with significant differences between countries. Current levels of engagement in data management were lower than for bibliometrics, but a majority anticipated future involvement, especially in technology assistance, data deposit, and policy development. Initiatives were aimed at multiple constituencies, with university administrators being important clients and partners for bibliometric services. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and confidence were significant constraints, with near-universal support for including bibliometrics and particularly data management in professional education and continuing development programs. The study also found that librarians need a multilayered understanding of the research environment. © 2013 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.},

abstract={Scientific and engineering research is heavily dependent on effective development and use of software artifacts. Many of these artifacts are produced by the scientists themselves, rather than by trained software engineers. To address the challenges in this area, a research community often referred to as "Development of Scientific Software" has emerged in the last few decades. As this research area has matured, there has been a sharp increase in the number of papers and results made available, and it has thus become important to summarize and provide an overview about those studies. Through a systematic mapping and bibliometrics study, we have reviewed 130 papers in this area. We present the results of our study in this paper. Also we have made the mapping data available on an online repository which is planned to be updated on a regular basis. The results of our study seem to suggest that many software engineering techniques and activities are being used in the development of scientific software. However, there is still a need for further exploration of the usefulness of specific software engineering techniques (e.g., regarding software maintenance, evolution, refactoring, re(v)-engineering, process and project management) in the scientific context. It is hoped that this article will help (new) researchers get an overview of the research space and help them to understand the trends in the area. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Objective: By the bibliometrics of high-quality biomedical engineering (BME) papers from mainland China based on JCR journals in the last 3 years..we try to provide references of formulating the policies of the science & technology development of BME. Methods: We retrieved the papers from web of knowledge and use the TDA and Excel to analyze. Results: from 1992 to 2011, the papers in the fields of medical imaging and biomaterials were increasing rapidly. The main funding agencies in China included the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Natural Science Foundation. The impact factor, average times cited per paper, average times cited per paper from 2008 to 2010 in the three fields were separately 2.832, 30.1, 3.81; 3.499, 25.2, 6.71; 6.573, 28.56, 6.11. Conclusions: The Chinese government's financial support plays an important role in the study of Biomedical Engineering. The study of biomedical engineering in Mainland China was active and the quality of BME papers published by the researchers from mainland China had been improved. The tech-focuses in medical imaging, biomaterials, cell & tissue engineering were mainly separately radiotherapy, image comparison and image fusion; silicon, mg alloys, drug and gene delivery systems and carriers; mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background: The h-index is used as an objective measure of research impact. Its validity, however, is not known in the context of general surgery and comparisons with other bibliometric indices are lacking. We sought to evaluate the h-index as a reliable and valid measure of research performance in general surgery across 6 universities in the province of Ontario, Canada. Methods: Bibliometric indices for 219 faculty members in general surgery were calculated using the Scopus and Web of Science online databases. We investigated agreement between the databases. A 2-way analysis of variance was used to compare the h-index of surgeons grouped by institutional affiliation and academic rank and to identify the relative impact of these factors on different bibliometric indices. Results: The agreement on h-indices between the Scopus and Web of Science was problematic. The h-index was associated more strongly with academic rank (academic rank accounted for 33.3% of researcher's h-index) than of the number of publications (12.5%) or the number of citations per author (10.2%). The number of citations per paper was not associated with academic rank. The institutional affiliation affected bibliometric indices to a similar degree to academic rank. Conclusion: Our data suggest better construct validity for the h-index than for other bibliometrics, although the agreement of h-index values between databases can be problematic for some researchers. The use of the h-index as a criterion-based assessment across different universities is problematic and that it should be used as a normative assessment tool, with comparisons with a specified population of interest. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

abstract={Evaluative bibliometrics is concerned with comparing research units by using statistical procedures. According to Williams (2012) an empirical study should be concerned with the substantive and practical significance of the findings as well as the sign and statistical significance of effects. In this study we will explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are and how useful they are for institutional evaluative bibliometrics. As an illustration, we will calculate a regression model using publications (and citation data) produced by four universities in German-speaking countries from 1980 to 2010. We will show how these predictions and effects can be estimated and plotted, and how this makes it far easier to get a practical feel for the substantive meaning of results in evaluative bibliometric studies. An added benefit of this approach is that it makes it far easier to explain results obtained via sophisticated statistical techniques to a broader and sometimes non-technical audience. We will focus particularly on Average Adjusted Predictions (AAPs), Average Marginal Effects (AMEs), Adjusted Predictions at Representative Values (APRVs) and Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MERVs). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={According to current research in bibliometrics, percentiles (or percentile rank classes) are the most suitable method for normalizing the citation counts of individual publications in terms of the subject area, the document type, and the publication year. Up to now, bibliometric research has concerned itself primarily with the calculation of percentiles. This study suggests how percentiles (and percentile rank classes) can be analyzed meaningfully for an evaluation study. Publication sets from four universities are compared with each other to provide sample data. These suggestions take into account on the one hand the distribution of percentiles over the publications in the sets (universities here) and on the other hand concentrate on the range of publications with the highest citation impact - that is, the range that is usually of most interest in the evaluation of scientific performance. © 2013 ASIS&T.},

abstract={While most professional psychologists are knowledgeable in scholarly database searching when conducting research, most practitioners are probably less familiarized with the rapidly advancing fields of bibliometrics, and, particularly, citation analysis. Due to the profusion of knowledge in the field, professional managers need to be cognizant of the major benefits of citation searching as a research tool (a) in identifying major trends and credibility level of issues in business, industry, management strategies and techniques, and applied psychology; and (b) in identifying the comprehensive acceptance of an expert's research and scholarly productivity across disciplines. One key strategic approach is referred to as cited-reference analysis, a rather intricate operational feature available in modern indexes such as Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO. The current article reviews recent literature in this area that should prove informative to the psychologist-manager. The review emphasizes published research on the topic of bibliometrics, over the past decade, in the disciplines of psychology and management. This analysis concludes that (a) cited-reference based results can vary largely and are contingent on the type of citation analysis performed; (b) databases, that offer citation options, rely on idiosyncratic methods, coverage, and transparency of functions; (c) the operational functions of citation analysis are rather perplex; and (d) research in this area is advancing at an exponential pace. Based on these concerns, the psychologist-manager would be well served to stay abreast of developments in bibliometrics research. An extended bibliography is provided as an addendum that provides scholarly sources for supplemental reading. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Objective To investigate the current status and development of electronic health records (EHR) at home and abroad to grasp the development trends of EHR, so as to point out the direction of the development and relevant research on EHR. Methods Based on the Web of Science citation database and the principle of bibliometrics, we analyzed the retrieved literature in aspects of publication date, language, country/region, institution, author, etc. Results A total of 1 262 eligible studies were identified. Te number of articles on EHR increased rapidly from only 2 in 1995 to 218 in 2012. In terms of country/region, the United States ranked the top in all countries (763 articles, accounting for 60.46%). In terms of institution, Harvard University ranked the top (135 articles, accounting for 10.70%). In terms of journal, the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association ranked the top (106 articles, accounting for 8.40%). In terms of authors, David W. Bates ranked the top (45 articles, accounting for 3.57%). In terms of subject type, health care sciences services and medical informatics were mainly focused on. Conclusion Te research on EHR has become a global hot spot and relevant bibliometrics will contribute to the timely and correctly grasp the whole picture of its development trends and main research direction. © 2013 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.},

abstract={Bibliometric measures are commonly used to estimate the popularity and the impact of published research. Existing bibliometric measures provide "quantitative" indicators of how good a published paper is. This does not necessarily reflect the "quality" of the work presented in the paper. For example, when hindex is computed for a researcher, all incoming citations are treated equally, ignoring the fact that some of these citations might be negative. In this paper, we propose using NLP to add a "qualitative" aspect to biblometrics. We analyze the text that accompanies citations in scientific articles (which we term citation context). We propose supervised methods for identifying citation text and analyzing it to determine the purpose (i.e. author intention) and the polarity (i.e. author sentiment) of citation. © 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={The assessment of scholarship assumes a central role in the evaluation of individual faculty, educational programs and academic fields. Because the production and assessment of scholarship is so central to the faculty role, it is incumbent upon decision makers to strive to make assessments of scholarship fair and equitable. This paper will focus on an approach to the assessment of the quantity and impact of the most important subset of an individual’s scholarship–peer-reviewed journal articles. The primary goal of this paper is to stimulate discussion regarding scholarship assessment in hiring, reappointment, tenure and promotion decisions. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={National Research Assessment Exercises (NRAEs) aim to improve returns from public funding of research. Critics argue that they undervalue publications influencing practice, not citations, implying that journals valued least by NRAEs are disproportionately useful to practitioners. Conservation biology can evaluate this criticism because it uses species recovery plans, which are practitioner-authored blueprints for recovering threatened species. The literature cited in them indicates what is important to practitioners' work. We profiled journals cited in 50 randomly selected recovery plans from each of the USA, Australia and New Zealand, using ranking criteria from the Australian Research Council and the SCImago Institute. Citations showed no consistent pattern. Sometimes higher ranked publications were represented more frequently, sometimes lower ranked publications. Recovery plans in all countries also contained 37 % or more citations to 'grey literature', discounted in NRAEs. If NRAEs discourage peer-reviewed publication at any level they could exacerbate the trend not to publish information useful for applied conservation, possibly harming conservation efforts. While indicating the potential for an impact does not establish that it occurs, it does suggest preventive steps. NRAEs considering the proportion of papers in top journals may discourage publication in lower-ranked journals, because one way to increase the proportion of outputs in top journals is by not publishing in lower ones. Instead, perhaps only a user-nominated subset of publications could be evaluated, a department's or an individual's share of the top publications in a field could be noted, or innovative new multivariate assessments of research productivity applied, including social impact. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={This commentary raises significant cautions related to inherent shortcomings in the use of bibliographic analytic technology, and in particular its use in substantive decision making around promotion and tenure. Questions are raised concerning the continued use of scholarly energy for bibliometric analysis of subtly different settings. The recommendation is offered that future efforts in bibliometrics must target methods to reduce methodological shortcomings. These include clarifying the metric used to “count” sole/multiple authorship, and to evaluate the “merit” of manuscripts as well as journals in which they appear. Finally, the fundamental meaning of the information produced in these analyses (i.e., the validity of the measure) must be clearly presented in order for it to be credibly used. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Bibliometrics in Social Work examiness the cross-disciplinary field of bibliometrics, including the multiple techniques and applications that have been described in the scholarly literature. Moving beyond this general overview, the authors examine applications of bibliometrics in social work. Subsequent chapters detail how the technique can be used to demonstrate the eventual impact on the field of publications in selected journals. These analyses are conducted using the bibliometric technique referred to as citation analysis. The authors then move on to present what will be a controversial proposal to some in the field: using bibliometrics techniques in making academic personnel decisions. The authors propose that hiring, retention, tenure and promotion decisions could be made more uniform and fair by using citation analysis. A series of experts in bibliometric analyses then critically respond to these initial chapters. The authors conclude by weaving their responses to these commentators with new scholarship on bibliometrics that has recently appeared.
This unique book is a valuable aid for social work scholars. Drawing on broad interdisciplinary streams of scholarship from around the world, the collection illuminates a field that is not well known to social workers. While cautiously advocating for a number of applications of the technique, the authors balance this position by presenting a comprehensive summary of the criticisms of the technique and by the inclusion of a series of critical commentaries by the leading experts on these issues in the field of social work. Bibliometrics in Social Work both summarizes what we know and pushes the field to think about how social work professionals can use this approach to improve our scholarship and the evaluation of scholars.
Bibliometrics in Social Work addreses:
• theoretical and methodological issuess
• pros and cons from the view of numerous bibliometric scholars
• bibliometrics outside of social work
• applications within social work previously reported in the literature
• estimates that have been reported in the literature of how much social workers publish and how much impact those publications have had
• how citation analysis can be used to analyzed a selection of publications in a single journal and their subsequent impact
• how citation analysis might be used to improve academic employment decisions
• concerns regarding self-citation and multiple authorship
• measurement issues in bibliometrics (e.g., age adjustments; concentration citedness, and uncitedness; the Price Index; lag times; persistence; synchronous and diachronous self-citations; the Multiple Author Qualifier)
Bibliometrics in Social Work critically examines these methods and their applications in social work. The book will be an enlightening read for social work scholars and those academic administrators involved in the evaluation of social work scholars, as well as academic librarians that support social work programs. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

This study illustrates the opportunities as well as the challenges for bibliometrics and citation analysis in the electronic environment. As more journals migrate to the digital environment, issues of access, copyright and fair use, online file formats, and idiosyncrasies in the digital files may limit the opportunities for bibliometric analysis. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={This paper investigates the fitness-for-purpose and soundness of bibliometric parameters for measuring and elucidating the research performance of individual researchers in the field of education sciences in Switzerland. In order to take into account the specificities of publication practices of researchers in education sciences, the analyses are based on two separate databases: Web of Science and Google Scholar. Both databases show a very unequal distribution of the individual research output, and the indicators used to measure research performance (quantity of publications and citation impact) from the two data sources are highly positively correlated. However, individual characteristics of the researchers, such as age, gender and academic position, that serve to explain the great variance in research performance, can only be identified if the Web of Science is used as a benchmark of research performance. The results indicate that Google Scholar is so inclusive that it impedes a meaningful interpretation of the data. However, the Web of Science inclusion policy for journals is also associated with certain shortcomings that put some researchers at an unjustified disadvantage. Therefore, problems currently exist in regard to both citation databases when used to benchmark individual research performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={A proposal is made in this paper for a broadening of perspective in evaluative bibliometrics by complementing the (standard) times cited with a cited reference analysis for a field-specific citation impact measurement. The times cited approach counts the citations of a given publication set. In contrast, we change the perspective and start by selecting all papers dealing with a specific research topic or field (the example in this study is research on Aspirin). Then we extract all cited references from the papers of this field-specific publication set and analyse which papers, scientists, and journals have been cited most often. In this study, we use the Chemical Abstracts registry number to select the publications for a specific field. However, the cited reference approach can be used with any other field classification system proposed up to now. © 2012.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the pertinence of Bradford's law applied to a set of electronic periodical collections in a given discipline. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied Bradford's law using citations rather than articles from a theme, thus ensuring the pertinence of the periodicals cited. Concentrating on citations in articles focuses on the stage following research rather than prior stages. The sources are actually used because they have been cited. Findings: The study demonstrates the data centrality phenomenon based on the leading periodicals in a theme. There was a relationship between the electronic periodical collection and the number of citations in the relevant journals in a theme. Originality/value: Although today's use of periodical titles is defined first and foremost by readership statistics, a more detailed analysis on the qualitative aspect can be an additional benefit in the negotiations conducted on a macro scale. Using Bradford's law could be envisaged as a complementary tool for a sustainable management of commercial electronic resources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The adoption of ecodesign considers the impacts on the environment in all organization's decisions, considering the same degree of importance given to, for example, profit, quality, aesthetics or ergonomics of the product. The purpose of this article is to conduct a literature study in a structured manner on the subject ecodesign. For this, a three-stage methodology (Planning, Implementation and Reporting) was used. It was considered in planning: research purpose definition and data source identification; time interval used; criteria for database selection; base tests and; publication type definition. The implementation consists of all the steps from searching databases and use of the criteria to arrive to a final sample of 132 articles that deal with this topic. The reporting is about bibliometric analysis performed on articles. With all these proposed procedures, it is intended, in the end, to demonstrate ways for the researcher to address the issue that he wishes, in this case the ecodesign and also to help identify gaps not yet explored this topic.},

abstract={Even though bibliometrics has been a well-defined research area within scientometrics for many years, uniformity in the conduct of bibliometric analyses has not yet been achieved. The numerous dos and don'ts that exist in the field represent the implicit knowledge of experienced users, rather than a clearly defined set of rules and operating procedures. Our chapter seeks to establish standards for applying bibliometrics to the evaluation of research institutes in a number of areas in the natural sciences. These standards refer to the selection of the underlying data from the reference databases, the statistical analysis of the data and the presentation of results. We draw upon anonymized data from six research institutes active in similar research areas to illustrate the applicability of our proposed standards.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates the potential of bibliometric analysis in the context of urban studies. After a brief discussion of the measurement of knowledge production, we provide an analysis of how the field of urban studies is constructed. We do this in three contexts: first, in the narrowly defined population of journals that constitutes the Thomson Reuters classification of urban studies; second, in the larger population of journals deemed to be within the social and behavioral sciences; and third, in a subset of the applied sciences. We find that, by using keyword analysis, it is possible to identify three distinct spheres of 'urban knowledge' that contain some overlap but also significant differences. We explore the significance of that for the development of urban studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={During the past decades, the deficiency of support tools for scientific research assessment policies led to applications development, focused on integrating citation complementary information: online usage statistics (webometrics/cybermetrics) and content analysis. However, due to lack of effective technical solutions, bibliometric data suppliers have refused to promote alternatives to the renowned and worn impact factor, with all its derivatives. The present research unveils enhanced bibliometrical tools, meeting comunity's needs and proposing an automatic solution to evaluate the scientific relevance of a research article, in a particular research field, in relation with all the citing works. This process resorts to semantic processing and conceptual similarity analysis, proved to be superior to solutions already abandoned, based on lexical analysis.},

abstract={Compared with traditional technologies, emerging technology presents some new features, e.g. uncertainty. Corresponding, technological innovation for emerging technologies faces many kinds of risks that dramatically affect their development paths. This paper illustrates how quantitative methods (Science, Technology & Innovation (ST&I) information resources) and qualitative approaches (experts input and technology assessment) could support the decision making through the different stages of technological innovation for the public or private sector in the emerging technology industry. It uses dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a case example. The combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches should yield robust assessment and should facilitate communication of results. It is useful for technology managers and policy-makers to grasp the development process and prospects for a specific emerging technology to facilitate innovation management. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present paper, the authors make a bibliometrics study on clinical indications of acupuncture therapy based on the published foreign articles about acupuncture clinical trials collected from PubMed database and Excerpta Medica database (EMbase). In 1996, 64 acupuncture indications were declared by WHO in Milan conference. But in recent 15 years, clinical trials have been conducted extensively in the foreign countries. Till now, 77 new indications for acupuncture therapy have been found in the foreign journals. The authors recommended that 29 indications (knee osteoarthritis, critique age problems, muscular fasciae ache, anxiety, etc.) should be added to the first class, 4 indications (irritable bowel syndrome, malposition, backache, simple obesity) should be upgraded from the second class to the first class, and the other 3 indications (childbirth pain, male and female barren) should be upgraded from the third class to the first class due to their application frequency in clinical trials. Increase of clinical indications reflects extensive application of acupuncture therapy and may help providing a better service for people's health.},

abstract={Objectives: To quantify and describe the characteristics of scientific production on the teaching of nursing leadership concerning the type of publication, year, vehicle, country, language and theme. Methods: A descriptive and bibliometric study conducted in databases of the BVS, using descriptors: teaching, leadership and nursing. Results: Over 37 years, we identified 73 publications, mostly found in the MEDLINE database and consisting of original articles published in North American journals, written in English, and dealing with teaching strategies. Conclusions: The scientific production was sparse but constant during the study period, authored predominantly by North Americans, and published in scientific journals in the United States, which indicated the necessity to develop research on the subject in Brazil.},

abstract={Over the last decades there has been a growing interest on developing research and formulating public policy by using the Innovation Systems approach. However, as evidenced on the academic literature there is a lack of systematic, chronological and synthesizing studies indicating how this field has evolved over time. This paper has as main objective to consolidate the state of the art of academic research on IS, based on a bibliometrics study on literature published over the past 35 years. The results are discussed under the following perspectives: general results, chronological distribution, author relevance, articles and cited references of relevance, journals relevance and institutions and countries relevance. The paper ends with a discussion of the main implications and limitations of the study. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Objective: To perform a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese and non-Chinese medical ethics literature using systematic research and literature analysis in order to discern research trends in the area and provide baseline data as a reference for relevant decision making and further study. Method: We retrieved articles using MeSH terms and keywords related to medical ethics in PubMed and CNKI, and then constructed a set of charts by applying word co-occurrence, The Pathfinder Networks algorithms, an included subject chart, a research field relationship chart, and strategy coordination charts. Result: The total of number of papers retrieved from PubMed was six times that retrieved from CNKI. Outside China, medical ethics has been studied in eight fully shaped subject fields, including morals, ethical review, physician-patient relationships, clinical trials, euthanasia, ethics education, clinical ethics, and health policy. In contrast, medical ethics research in China is still confined to five subject fields: morals, physician-patient relations, medical ethics education, ethical review, and medical research. Conclusion: Medical ethics research outside China emphasizes the application of medical ethics to solve emerging problems in clinical and medical research. It is mainly centered on morals, ethical review, and physician-patient relations. By comparison, medical ethics research in China places greater emphasis on morals and medical education. In order to narrow this gap between China and other countries, we should broaden the research scope of medical ethics and add more applied research, such as ethical review and medical education. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University.},

abstract={Google Scholar, the academic bibliographic database provided free-of-charge by the search engine giant Google, has been suggested as an alternative or complementary resource to the commercial citation databases like Web of Knowledge (ISI/Thomson) or Scopus (Elsevier). In order to check the usefulness of this database for bibliometric analysis, and especially research evaluation, a novel approach is introduced. Instead of names of authors or institutions, a webometric analysis of academic web domains is performed. The bibliographic records for 225 top level web domains (TLD), 19,240 university and 6,380 research centres institutional web domains have been collected from the Google Scholar database. About 63. 8% of the records are hosted in generic domains like. com or. org, confirming that most of the Scholar data come from large commercial or non-profit sources. Considering only institutions with at least one record, one-third of the other items (10. 6% from the global) are hosted by the 10,442 universities, while 3,901 research centres amount for an additional 7. 9% from the total. The individual analysis show that universities from China, Brazil, Spain, Taiwan or Indonesia are far better ranked than expected. In some cases, large international or national databases, or repositories are responsible for the high numbers found. However, in many others, the local contents, including papers in low impact journals, popular scientific literature, and unpublished reports or teaching supporting materials are clearly overrepresented. Google Scholar lacks the quality control needed for its use as a bibliometric tool; the larger coverage it provides consists in some cases of items not comparable with those provided by other similar databases. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

The study applies bibliometric method to the articles published in the field of mechanism and machine theory (MMT). Afterward we analyzed the trends of MMT articles during the 30 years. We found that the ratios of the MMT papers in each journal have a trend of growth and have been centered on the certain two magazines. The articles of MMT exhibit a trend of growth. The USA, China and Canada are the major countries which frequently published the papers in the field of MMT and have significant performance in citations. China has rapidly grown in the quantity and the ratios of papers. In addition, the top 10 researchers with the highest h-index in the field of MMT are primarily affiliated with institutions in English-spoken countries, trumping the other countries. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the research literature on L2 vocabulary acquisition published in 2006. The paper uses a methodology known as Inclusive Author Co-citation. The method uses the pattern of citations appearing in a body of research papers to generate a map of an area of research. These maps reveal 'hidden colleges' within a subject field.The analysis presented here is based on citation data for 101 authors who are significantly cited in the 2006 literature. The analysis identifies four research clusters in the data. The two principle clusters-accounting for 96% of the data-are a psycholinguistic cluster dominated by de Groot, Kroll and David Green, and a mainstream vocabulary cluster dominated by Nation and Laufer. The two clusters are largely self-contained, with very dense patterns of connections between the members of the individual clusters. The analysis identifies only a small number of links between these two clusters. The network dissolves into 30 smaller clusters if the main players are removed from the analysis.The analysis broadly supports intuitive analyses of the L2 vocabulary acquisition literature, but provides some new objective data which supports these intuitions. The paper also suggests that co-citation analysis of this sort might provide a way of mapping changes in the discipline over time. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Most often, bibliometrics quantify two measures: the number of publications and citations. Humans have been publishing and citing since very early in history with individual works containing citations that date back as far as antiquity. The term "bibliometrics", however, was defined later, in 1969. The following article represents a short history of early bibliometrics, a subdiscipline of information science, up to this important year. Using exemplary studies and publications, the beginnings of publications and citations are illustrated and the disciplinary framework described. The origin of the history of bibliometrics is assigned differently by various authors. The different possibilities are presented and discussed. The article closes with a description of the increasing importance of bibliometrics in our current age of information.},

abstract={Objectives: Analyze the results of the bibliometric system and analysis of scientific publications (SIGAPS) in the Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) and compare the scientific production among the various surgical disciplines of the academic hospitals of Paris and define the place of urology. Methods: The publications from 115 surgical departments between 2006 and 2008 were included. Only surgical departments were considered in the current study. The following data were taken into account: the hospital department of origin, the number of articles published, the number of first place, last places, the number of full-time unit, the SIGAPS score. Statistical analysis focused on the quality and on the quantity of published articles per surgeons and per department. There were eight academic departments of urology identified within the AP-HP. Results: The database contained information for 115 surgical departments. The mean number of articles published by department was 42.89±27.34 (13.2 to 110.75). The mean number of publications per full-time surgeon was 6.7±2.59 (3.77 to 12.84), or a mean of 2.25±0.86 released by full-time and by year. The median score SIGAPS of surgery was 304 with a wide interval (122 to 903.5). Urology was the specialty with the highest median score compared to other surgical specialties. The department, which published the most, was the center 1, in comparison with the center 6 which was publishing the most in A/B ranking journals. Conclusion: Urology was the absolute leader by far in terms of scientific publications in the AP-HP when compared to other surgical disciplines. The discipline is organized efficiently to juggle clinical work and research indicating a certain dynamism of the teams that invest there to fulfill the missions assigned to them in the University Hospital and the part of the autonomy of the universities. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Many discussions have enlarged the literature in Bibliometrics since the Hirsch proposal, the so called h-index. Ranking papers according to their citations, this index quantifies a researcher only by its greatest possible number of papers that are cited at least h times. A closed formula for h-index distribution that can be applied for distinct databases is not yet known. In fact, to obtain such distribution, the knowledge of citation distribution of the authors and its specificities are required. Instead of dealing with researchers randomly chosen, here we address different groups based on distinct databases. The first group is composed of physicists and biologists, with data extracted from Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). The second group is composed of computer scientists, in which data were extracted from Google-Scholar system. In this paper, we obtain a general formula for the h-index probability density function (pdf) for groups of authors by using generalized exponentials in the context of escort probability. Our analysis includes the use of several statistical methods to estimate the necessary parameters. Also an exhaustive comparison among the possible candidate distributions are used to describe the way the citations are distributed among authors. The h-index pdf should be used to classify groups of researchers from a quantitative point of view, which is meaningfully interesting to eliminate obscure qualitative methods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Citations to published work are gaining increasing prominence in evaluations of the research performance of scientists. Considering the importance accorded to gender issues in South African science, it is surprising that (to our knowledge) no research has as yet ascertained the extent of sex differences in citations to the published work of scientists in this country. Our literature study shows that studies that have been conducted elsewhere tend to neglect in their analyses important gender-related and other factors, such as the sex composition of multi-authored papers and the extent of foreign co-authorship. Against this background, we illustrate the difficulties inherent in measuring the quality aspect of sex-specific research performance by means of an analysis of a dataset of articles (n = 229) that were published between 1990 and 2002 in the field of invasion ecology and in journals included in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science. Each article has at least one South African author address. The results indicate that foreign co-authorship is a better correlate of high citations than the sex of South African authors, and this is true irrespective of whether the annual citation rate or window period is used, whether or not self-citations are excluded, and whether or not the number of authors is controlled for by calculating fractional counts. The paper highlights these and other considerations that are relevant for future gender-focused bibliometric research, both in South Africa and beyond. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={This study investigated the longitudinal trends of e-learning research using text mining techniques. Six hundred and eighty-nine (689) refereed journal articles and proceedings were retrieved from the Science Citation Index/Social Science Citation Index database in the period from 2000 to 2008. All e-learning publications were grouped into two domains with four groups/15 clusters based on abstract analysis. Three additional variables: subject areas, prolific countries and prolific journals were applied to data analysis and data interpretation. Conclusions include that e-learning research is at the early majority stage and foci have shifted from issues of the effectiveness of e-learning to teaching and learning practices. Educational studies and projects and e-learning application in medical education and training are growing fields with the highest potential for future research. Approaches to e-learning differ between leading countries and early adopter countries, and government policies play an important role in shaping the results. © 2010 The Author.},

abstract={Bibliometrics has been both studied and applied in a variety of research fields, such as Library and Information Science (LIS), Sociology, history of science, business, management and research policy. In the LIS field, however, there has been an interesting phenomenon: Bibliometrics is quite strong in research as seen from bibliometric maps of LIS literature, but very weak in education as seen from LIS course offerings. This phenomenon invites serious questions, such as • Why is this the case? • Who is doing Bibliometrics? Where and how do they get their training? • Are these kinds of training enough for conducting quality research? • Why or why not should we strengthen Bibliometrics education in LIS programs in North America? • What should be a proper place of Bibliometrics in LIS education? The panelists, who are both Bibliometrics researchers and university LIS educators from different regions of the world, will share their views of these and related questions. The panel will start with opening remarks from each panelist in the format of 20×20 presentations, and will then open the floor for discussion among the panelists and with the audience. This panel is expected to benefit both research and education in LIS.},

abstract={Bibliometric analyses enable the measurement of scientific information and allow an evaluation of scientific productivity and efficiency within certain limits. On the other hand an ongoing interest in webometric analysis can be observed. Till now these two parts of informetrics research areas are separated in their interpretation. In this paper wewill summarize our experiences in terms of providing a holistic view on both bibliometric and webometric studies with the help of TopicMapsbased ontologies. We will explain the problems dealing with the visualization of quantitative aspects of TopicMaps with the help of a special framework. Finally we will give an outlook on the potential of ontologies providing an expanded view on the examined context. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Objective: The h-index allows the evaluation of scholarly output in academics, but this bibliometric statistic has not been applied extensively to measure productivity in anesthesiology. The authors tested the hypothesis that the h-index is dependent on academic rank, American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation of the training program, and National Board of Echocardiography credentials in perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in United States academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Design: Observational. Setting: Internet analysis. Participants: United States academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Faculty members from 30 randomly selected fellowship programs with or without accreditation were identified using the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists web site. The status of each faculty member's credentials in perioperative TEE was defined using the "verify certification" function on the National Board of Echocardiography web site. Publications, citations, citations/publication, and the h-index for each faculty member were obtained using Scopus. Two hundred fifty-nine cardiothoracic anesthesiologists (204 men and 55 women) were identified (8 instructors [3%], 123 assistant professors [48%], 56 associate professors [22%], 63 professors [24%], and 9 chairpersons [3%]). The average cardiothoracic anesthesiologist had an h-index of 6 ± 7 with 28 ± 46 publications, 499 ± 988 total citations, and 13 ± 18 citations per publication. The h-index increased significantly (p < 0.05) among ranks (instructors [1 ± 1], assistant professors [3 ± 3], associate professors [7 ± 5], professors [12 ± 8], and chairpersons [18 ± 13]). Significant differences in the number of publications and total citations also were observed among ranks. Differences in the h-index among ranks were observed regardless of program accreditation status or transesophageal echocardiographic credentials. Faculty members working in American College of Graduate Medical Educationaccredited programs had more publications and citations and higher h-indices than their counterparts in programs that were not accredited. Except for program directors, the scholarly output of academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists with or without transesophageal echocardiographic credentials was similar within each academic rank. Conclusions: The results show that the h-index increases progressively with academic rank and is dependent on fellowship program accreditation status but not transesophageal echocardiographic credentials in United States academic cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The h-index is used to evaluate scholarly productivity in academic medicine, but has not been extensively used in anaesthesia. We analysed the publications, citations, citations per publication and h-index from 1996 to date using the Scopus® database for 1630 (1120 men, 510 women) for faculty members from 24 randomly selected US academic anaesthesiology departments The median (interquartile range [range]) h-index of US academic anaesthesiologists was 1 [0-5 (0-44)] with 3 [0-18 (0-398)] total publications, 24 [0-187 (0-8515)] total citations, and 5 [0-14 (0-252)] citations per publication. Faculty members in departments with National Institutes of Health funding were more productive than colleagues in departments with little or no government funding. The h-index increased significantly between successive academic ranks concomitant with increases in the number of publications and total citations. Men had higher median h-index than women concomitant with more publications and citations, but the number of citations per publication was similar between groups. Our results suggest that h-index is a reasonable indicator of scholarly productivity in anaesthesia. The results may help comparisons of academic productivity across countries and may be used to assess whether new initiatives designed to reverse recent declines in academic anaesthetic are working. © 2011 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.},

abstract={Objective: To analysis the paper and citation of 11 journals of Traditional Chinese Medicine, with the aim to provide a reference for the evaluation of those journals. Method: A bibliometric analysis was conducted to study 11 journals of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its papers. Results: The total amount of the published papers increased from 3570 in 2003 to 5951 in 2009; funded papers increased from 26.70% to 62.14%; 5 of the journals shortened the issues, the other 6 journals increased the pages.24413 authors published their papers in 2009, the average cooperation degree of the authors was 4.10; 72.47% of the papers were from universities and their affiliated hospitals; the average publishing stagnant time was 283.46 days; the average number of citations per article was 8.94; the main (84.85%) type of the citation was journal literature; language of the citations was mainly (71.09%) Chinese; the Price Index was 40.35%. Conclusion: The journals of Traditional Chinese Medicine made a rapid development during the past few years, and the academic level increased gradually. Universities and their affiliated hospitals are the major outputs of research papers. The publishing stagnant time is relatively long. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Background Bibliometrics provide surrogate measures of the quality and quantity of research undertaken by departments and individuals. Previous reports have suggested that academic anaesthesia research in the UK is in decline. We wished to provide a comprehensive description of current and historical published output of UK anaesthesia researchers. Methods Bibliometric indices (Web of Science®) were calculated for anaesthesia researchers in the UK for the whole period covered by the database, and for 2004-8. A parallel search was made using the Scholarometer™ tool, which parses output from Google Scholar™. Calculated indices included total number of publications; total number of citations; citations per paper; h-index; g-index; and modified impact index. Results One hundred and four individuals and 23 academic departments were identified. Median values (inter-quartile range) for the indices were: total papers 57 (24-95) (individuals for the whole period), 11 (6-20) (individuals 2004-8), 50 (30-70) (departments 2004-8); total number of citations 571 (175-1328), 93 (38-207), 383 (239-845); h-index 13 (8-20), 6 (3-8), 11 (9-14). Four departments were ranked in the top 5 for all indices. Conclusions The general distribution of bibliometric data is similar to that seen in other specialities in Europe and North America. Four departments contribute to more than 50 of published anaesthesia research output in this data set. These data provide useful comparative tools for individuals, departments, and national bodies. © The Author [2011].},

abstract={The present study had as objective to carry through a bibliometric survey on domestic violence from articles from an international database indexs. Electronic search in three different databases was carried through (Web of Science, Psyc Info and Lilacs). It associated expression "domestic violence" with the words: "man", "woman", "child", adolescent" and "elderly". The articles published between the years of 2006 and 2009 had been selected, which had been analyzed through the reading of the heading and abstracts. From the 636 collected articles most was published in the 2006 year. They were more published by the magazines: "Journal of Family Violence", "Violence Against Women" and "Journal of Interpersonal Violence". Women victims had constituted the main focus of articles, followed of children. The biggest part of publications approach only one type of victim of the family violence. The identification of the man as practioner of the domestic violence predominated.},

The data for the study were obtained from core journals of China journal net database and engineering village(EI) from 1990 to 2009. Statistical analysis of citation number and word frequency was made on the data. The results reveal the most representative authors and journals by examining the citation number. Word frequency analysis presents that some relevant information technology contributing to the achievement of MES is developed increasingly at home. And the research abroad is entered a more mature stage, emphasizing on the analysis and decision making of problems by applying the results of MES.},

abstract={Quantitative analysis of publications and their citations, a procedure known as bibliometrics, has become increasingly important in the evaluation of scientists and clinicians. In the clinical setting, bibliometrics is used for the calculation of hospital budgets. While bibliometrics is attractive because it rapidly provides numbers that bear a certain relation to scientific productivity, it is often misused. The parameters chosen are questionable and sometimes worthless because of material errors or inappropriate use. More importantly, reducing the activity of a scientist or physician simply to the number of his or her publications or citations, without analyzing the importance and impact of the work itself, can lead to serious errors.},

abstract={National research assessment exercises are becoming regular events in ever more countries. The present work contrasts the peer-review and bibliometrics approaches in the conduct of these exercises. The comparison is conducted in terms of the essential parameters of any measurement system: accuracy, robustness, validity, functionality, time and costs. Empirical evidence shows that for the natural and formal sciences, the bibliometric methodology is by far preferable to peer-review. Setting up national databases of publications by individual authors, derived from Web of Science or Scopus databases, would allow much better, cheaper and more frequent national research assessments. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={This study explores the entire archive of RAE-eletrônica, consisting of 240 articles in 18 editions, from 2002 to 2010, using techniques of bibliometrics, social network analysis and geographic analysis. It analyzes the content, involving titles, keywords, summary and body of texts; collaboration between authors and institutions; most influential journals and conferences, and citations and self-citations involving authorship and references. It concludes that the RAE-eletrônica collection largely reflects the characteristics of the universe of recent academic administration production in Brazil, due to the greater influence of RAE and international journals, and Anpad conferences. Highlights are FGV-EAESP, USP and UFRGS as the most influential institutions of the collection. Terms like "company", "organization" and "work" are among the most mentioned in the texts, while "management" is the most frequent keyword. The combined use of the techniques explored in this article leverages its appropriation to other sets of articles and scientific fields.},

abstract={Academic nurses are increasingly turning to bibliometrics to assess the state and status of research publication in nursing in countries around the world. Early bibliometric studies were carried out by Cattell as part of a project to advance research in psychology in the early decades of the 20th century. There are some echoes in nursing's moves to increase its standing over the last 40years. The interpretation of bibliometric studies can reveal embedded values about academic disciplinary activity and normative views of scientific work. Patterns of publishing by nurse academics appear increasingly to resemble those in biomedicine as a whole. © 2011 The Author. International Nursing Review © 2011 International Council of Nurses.},

abstract={This paper deals with the specific features of historical papers relevant for information retrieval and bibliometrics. The analysis is based mainly on the citation indexes accessible under the Web of Science (WoS) but also on field-specific databases: the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) literature database and the INSPEC database. First, the journal coverage of the WoS (in particular of the WoS Century of Science archive), the limitations of specific search fields as well as several database errors are discussed. Then, the problem of misspelled citations and their "mutations" is demonstrated by a few typical examples. Complex author names, complicated journal names, and other sources of errors that result from prior citation practice are further issues. Finally, some basic phenomena limiting the meaning of citation counts of historical papers are presented and explained. © 2011 ASIST.},

abstract={Recent literature on issues relevant to bibliometric indicator relations and peer review discusses whether bibliometric indicators can predict the success of research grant applications. For example, Van den Besselaar and Leydesdorff (2009) reported a higher average number of publications/citations for the group of approved applicants than for the rejected applicants (section Social and Behavioral Sciences of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [NOW], MaGW). However, this difference disappears or even reverses when the group of 275 successful applicants was compared only to the best 275 rejected applicants. Given these findings, we have continued our analyses of publication data of applicants for the Emmy Noether-Programme (ENP) provided by the German Research Foundation. First, we compared the group of actual ENP applicants to a sample of potential applicants, which revealed a 'lack of low performers' among the actual ENP applicants. Furthermore, we conducted discriminant analyses to predict funding decisions on the basis of several bibliometric indicators. © Beech Tree Publishing 2011.},

abstract={National exercises for the evaluation of research activity by universities are becoming regular practice in ever more countries. These exercises have mainly been conducted through the application of peer-review methods. Bibliometrics has not been able to offer a valid large-scale alternative because of almost overwhelming difficulties in identifying the true author of each publication. We will address this problem by presenting a heuristic approach to author name disambiguation in bibliometric datasets for large-scale research assessments. The application proposed concerns the Italian university system, comprising 80 universities and a research staff of over 60,000 scientists. The key advantage of the proposed approach is the ease of implementation. The algorithms are of practical application and have considerably better scalability and expandability properties than state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. Moreover, the performance in terms of precision and recall, which can be further improved, seems thoroughly adequate for the typical needs of large-scale bibliometric research assessments. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={The trend to use administrative health care databases as research material is increasing but not well explored. Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), one of the largest administrative health care databases around the world, has been used widely in academic studies. This study analyzed 383 NHIRD studies published between 2000 and 2009 to quantify the effects on overall growth, scholar response, and spread of the study fields. The NHIRD studies expanded rapidly in both quantity and quality since the first study was published in 2000. Researchers usually collaborated to share knowledge, which was crucial to process the NHIRD data. However, once the fundamental problem had been overcome, success to get published became more reproducible. NHIRD studies were also published diversely in a growing number of journals. Both general health and clinical science studies benefited from NHIRD. In conclusion, this new research material widely promotes scientific production in a greater magnitude. The experience of Taiwan's NHIRD should encourage national- or institutional-level data holders to consider re-using their administrative databases for academic purposes. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={One of the most influential contributions to the fields of science policy research and science and technology studies during the last 20 years was The New Production of Knowledge by Gibbons et al. (Gibbons, M., Limoges, C., Nowotny, H., Schwartzman, S., Scott, P. and Trow, M. (1994) The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies, Sage, London). The authors argued that over recent decades a different form of knowledge production has emerged, one which they termed 'Mode 2'. In this, knowledge is produced in the context of application, generally on the basis of transdisciplinary research efforts, by a heterogeneous range of institutional actors, who are subject to wider social accountability and more diverse forms of quality control than in the traditional 'Mode 1' knowledge production. Although there have been a number of attempts to examine the claims of The New Production of Knowledge empirically, the evidence is, at best, rather ambiguous. The study reported here analyses highly cited publications in the field of bibliometric research to establish whether the themes of those publications and, more specifically, the changes in these themes over the last 20 years, provide any evidence of a growing incidence of Mode 2 knowledge production. The paper concludes that there is some evidence that bibliometrics, as a field of research, has exhibited a shift towards Mode 2 knowledge production over the last two decades. In addition, it would seem to have played a part in a similar shift across science more generally, offering policy-relevant tools and analyses, helping scientific research to respond to increased demands for accountability, and contributing to changes in the approach to the quality assessment of research. At the same time, and perhaps inadvertently, it may have contributed to bringing about changes in publication and citation practices as more and more authors seek to maximise their 'score' on one or more bibliometric indicators. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper aims to establish the historical weight that this institution represents regarding its production of scientific publications as registered in the Web of Science (WoS), relative to the whole country. The WoS was queried by using the term "Venezuela" as "Country of Origin for the Publication" in order to generate a database, which in turn was used as the source for the current study and for a time frame ranging from 1981 to 2007. Entries corresponding to Health and Quality of Life were segmented based on the UNESCO taxonomy using a functionality offered by the software BIBLIOS. These findings show the importance that research developed by the UCV in these fields of knowledge has for Venezuelan society.},

abstract={As the "Healthcare Management and Service" began a full exploration of all the possibilities in every research domain at least one decade, this paper is mainly focusing on the trend study of publications which subjects as renowned "Healthcare Management and Service" related papers on Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) database from ISI Web of Knowledge (WoK)1. In order to verify if the distribution of publications can be held by Lotka' Law, Price's Law and Pareto Principle, the complete and complete-normalized counting methods were used to calculate the metadata of all collected publications. The result of this study has several outcomes. First, only Lotka's Law with complete counting method could hold the distribution of contribution indexes of author productivity. Second, authors were less prolific (average one publication has 3.57 co-authors and 92.78% of authors contributed to only one publication). Third, top 4 out of 87 subject areas contributed around 64.49% of all publications and about 50% of publications are categorized into two or more subject areas. Finally, by reading ISI WoK SSCI database, this field still keeps the form of co-authorship and interdisciplinary publishing for having 1,477 co-authors to generate 370 publications in different subject areas. The major research power in this field and the published papers are dramatically growing up from 2008 to 2010. Nowadays, the amount of contributions is still on the peak period but facing the less prolific authors who may not have incentive to publish more than one publication.},

abstract={As the improvement of computing power, texting mining becomes more focused than before. In order to realize the literature productivity of such territory, we analyze the literatures on SSCI database with subjects as "Text Mining". Applied the methodology of bibliometrics, we found several outcomes in this research. First, the distribution of frequency indexes of author's productivity fulfills Lotka's Law. Second, we also apply Price's Square Root Law & Pareto Principle to check the result and found that are not compliance with both of these. Third, from the distribution of the number of paper published each year we conclude the topic of "Text Mining" is still in peak period but may achieve mature stage in the near future. Finally, 56.25% of authors only contribute 1 paper and 82.74% authors' outcomes are less or equal 3. Contrarily, there are 6 authors with over 10 published papers and the most productive one even owns 37 papers on SSCI database.},

abstract={It has been already about 90 years since original study of bibliometric, formed a fully-fledged discipline-Bibliometrics. With the depth of quantitative research and effect of social environment, Informetrics has evolved on the basis of Bibliometrics. And along with sharply increase of Internet Information Resources, Webometrics has emerged as required. In this paper, the date resources about Bibliometrics, Informetrics and Webometrics are come from ISI Web of knowledge. The author tries to use the information visualization techniques of dynamic network analysis-CiteSpace II, draw the knowledge map of literature's co-citation to identify the important achievements and representative scientists. At the same time, the author draws the knowledge map of evolution of Bibliometrics' hotspot, directly shows the development of the evolution from Bibliometrics to Webometrics.},

At the same time, the theory of small world is penetrated in this paper, just like co-word analysis and co-author analysis which are the phenomenon of small world. Prying into and understanding the scientific development of a research field, even a subject, now the scholars could try to use this method both in the macro and micro. Co-word and co-author can reflect the macroscopic outline, but hubs and authorities can reflect the microscopic details in the scientific field. Using the hub and authority method, it can be seen that in the small world research field, four papers are the most important, which are respectively published by Albert R (2002), Dorogovtsev S N (2002), Newman M E J (2003) and Boccaletti S (2006).},

abstract={The research industry is like any other market, and has research producers, products and consumers. There is a wide variety of bibliometric measures available for use in evaluating research. Measures can be directed at aspects of research producers(authors, affiliations, and funding bodies), the characteristics of research product(research design and topic, sample population, data analyses) or made at the consumption level(citations). The purpose of this systematic review was to identify which parts of the research production process are assessed, and more specifically, the most commonly used bibliometric measures in peer-reviewed health literature between 2000 and 2009. Results revealed there were many different bibliometric measures used, with a relative predominance of those that were relatively simple to use(such as numeric or binary data). Measures were made across all aspects of the research production process(producers, product and consumption) but typically at the research product level.},

abstract={As the improvement of computing power, texting mining becomes more focused than before. In order to realize the literature productivity of such territory, we analyze the literatures on SSCI database with subjects as "Text Mining". Applied the methodology of bibliometrics, we found several outcomes in this research. First, the distribution of frequency indexes of author's productivity fulfills Lotka's Law. Second, we also apply Price's Square Root Law & Pareto Principle to check the result and found that are not compliance with both of these. Third, from the distribution of the number of paper published each year we conclude the topic of "Text Mining" is still in peak period but may achieve mature stage in the near future. Finally, 56.25% of authors only contribute 1 paper and 82.74% authors' outcomes are less or equal 3. Contrarily, there are 6 authors with over 10 published papers and the most productive one even owns 37 papers on SSCI database.},

A life-cycle output analysis traces phases in the development of CWTS, Anthony's institute at Leiden University. Other contributions in this issue focus on the longterm importance of a paper's references as exemplified by landmark scholarly texts and the phenomenon of 'Sleeping Beauties'. Several papers focus on how the autonomy of institutes and researchers is related to bibliometric research evaluation. High-quality S&T indicators can act as structuring devises in policy debate and collective learning processes. We also learn about the need for statistical tests to distinguish among researchers with a similar h-index. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.},

Findings indicate that bibliometrics could have required application in the area of digital resources available through Net. Link analysis is a process by which one could make statistical analysis of correlation between hyperlinks and therefore understand the accuracy, veracity and efficacy of citations within a digital document. Link analysis, in effect, is counted as a part of information ranking algorithm within the web environment. The number, linkage and quality of given links to a website are of utmost importance for ranking/status in the Web. The tools applied in this topic include, page ranking strategy, link analysis algorithm, latent semantic indexing and the classical input-output model. The present study analyzes Big Web and Small Web link analysis and explains the means for utilizing web charts in order to better understand the link analysis process.},

abstract={This paper examines the role of bibliometrics in exploring the question of the effect of commercialization upon the health of American science. It approaches the problem through the question: What would constitute relevant evidence documenting decline in the number of scientific articles published by American authors in the last two decades? Because even the data have been privatized recently, it begins by criticizing article counts used in other venues. It concludes by demonstrating that the problem of decline is not merely in relative shares between countries, but also an absolute decline in American-authored articles across the board. We close with some proposed causes of the decline. © 2010 A.E.S.},

abstract={The publications in scientometrics and bibliometrics with Brazilian authorship expanded exponentially in the 1990-2006 period, reaching 13 times in the Web of Science database and 19.5 times in the Google Scholar database. This increase is rather superior to that of the total Brazilian scientific production in the same time period (5.6 times in the Web of Science). Some characteristics to be noticed in this rise are: 1) The total number of articles during this period was 197; in that, 78% were published in 57 Brazilian journals and 22% in 13 international journals. 2) The national and international articles averaged 4.3 and 5.9 citations/article, respectively; two journals stood out among these, the national Ciência da Informação (44 articles averaging 6.7 citations/article) and the international Scientometrics (32 articles averaging 6.2 citations/article). 3) The articles encompass an impressive participation of authors from areas other than information science; only one-fourth of the authors are bound to the information science field, the remaining ones being distributed among the areas of humanities/business administration, biology/biomedicine, health and hard sciences. The occurrence of adventitious authors at this level of multidisciplinarity is uncommon in science. However, the possible benefits of such patterns are not clear in view of a fragmented intercommunication among the authors, as noticed through the citations. The advantages of changing this trend and of using other scientometric and bibliometric databases, such as SciELO, to avoid an almost exclusive use of the Web of Science database, are discussed.},

abstract={The past 15 years (1995-2009) witnessed an annual growth of the literature on patent indicators. However, no research was done to examine the patent indicators systematically and comprehensively. This paper reviewed the literature and current application of patent indicators in Taiwan to provide references for the future revision, application, and studies. The researchers first searched the literature using the expert keywords group; then studied the key literature by content analysis, such as using statistics to compare the publications and the application of patent indicators in industries. The findings are as follows: 1. The ways that patent indicators have been used are various and researchers usually combine multiple indicators to use. 2. The study on patent indicators in Taiwan needs to be improved in terms of quantity. 3. There are seven major research teams dedicated to the study of patent indicators in Taiwan. 4. The relationship is not significant between the usage of patent indicators and the financial performance of industries. 5. Comparing with private universities, the state-owned universities obtained 73% of government support for the research of patent indicators. 6. The empirical studies on patent indicators in industries are relevant to the government high-tech policy planning. 7. Bibliometrics is a valid method to study patent information. This research is the first one to use statistics to analyze the literatures of patent indicators. Since it includes more than one industrial evidence, it provides valuable references for the future studies.},

abstract={We propose a new hybrid clustering framework to incorporate text mining with bibliometrics in journal set analysis.The framework integrates two different approaches: clustering ensemble and kernel-fusion clustering. To improve the flexibility and the efficiency of processing large-scale data, we propose an information-based weighting scheme to leverage the effect of multiple data sources in hybrid clustering. Three different algorithms are extended by the proposed weighting scheme and they are employed on a large journal set retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The clustering performance of the proposed algorithms is systematically evaluated using multiple evaluation methods, and they were cross-compared with alternative methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighted hybrid clustering strategy is superior to other methods in clustering performance and efficiency. The proposed approach also provides a more refined structural mapping of journal sets, which is useful for monitoring and detecting new trends in different scientific fields. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={As bibliometric indicators are objective, reliable, and cost-effective measures of peer-reviewed research outputs, they are expected to play an increasingly important role in research assessment/management. Recently, a bibliometric approach was developed and integrated within the evaluation framework of research funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC). This approach helped address the following questions that were difficult to answer objectively using alternative methods such as program documentation review and key informant interviews: (a) Has the NCIC peer-review process selected outstanding Canadian scientists in cancer research? (b) Have the NCIC grants contributed to increasing the scientific performance of supported researchers? (c) How do the NCIC-supported researchers compare to their neighbors supported by the U.S. National Cancer Institute? Using the NCIC evaluation as a case study, this article demonstrates the usefulness of bibliometrics to address key evaluation questions and discusses its integration, along complementary indicators (e.g., peer ratings), in a practice-driven research evaluation continuum. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={The allocation of resources for research is increasingly based on so-called 'bibliometrics'. Scientists are now deemed to be successful on the sole condition that their work be abundantly cited. This world-wide trend appears to enjoy support not only by granting agencies (whose task is obviously simplified by extensive recourse to bibliometrics), but also by the scientists themselves (who seem to enjoy their status of celebrities). This trend appears to be fraught with dangers, particularly in the area of social sciences, where bibliometrics are less developed, and where monographs (which are not taken into account in citation indexes) are often more important than articles published in journals. We argue in favour of a return to the values of 'real science', in analogy to the much-promised return to a 'real economy'. While economists may strive towards a more objective evaluation of the prospects of a company, a market, or an industrial sector, we scientists can only base our appraisal on a responsible practice of peer review. Since we fear that decision-takers of granting agencies such as the FNRS, CTI, EPFL, ETHZ, ANR, CNRS, NIH, NSF, DOE,[1] etc. will be too busy to read our humble paper in Chimia, we appeal to scientists of all countries and disciplines to unite against the tyranny of bibliometrics. © Schweizerische Chemische Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Since the publication of Robert K. Merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (Matthew Effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions, or countries. However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic "quality" of papers or of researchers-"better" (however defined) papers or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. Using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers-identical duplicate papers published in different journals with different impact factors-this paper shows that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers published in highimpact journals obtain, on average, twice as many citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not, there is a specific Matthew Effect attached to journals and this gives to papers published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality. © 2009 ASIS&T.},

abstract={In this study an attempt is made to establish new bibliometric indicators for the assessment of research in the Humanities. Data from a Dutch Faculty of Humanities was used to provide the investigation a sound empirical basis. For several reasons (particularly related to coverage) the standard citation indicators, developed for the sciences, are unsatisfactory. Target expanded citation analysis and the use of oeuvre (lifetime) citation data, as well as the addition of library holdings and productivity indicators enable a more representative and fair assessment. Given the skew distribution of population data, individual rankings can best be determined based on log transformed data. For group rankings this is less urgent because of the central limit theorem. Lifetime citation data is corrected for professional age by means of exponential regression. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={To obtain correlated and complementary information contained in text mining and bibliometrics, hybrid clustering to incorporate textual content and citation information has become a popular strategy. In this paper, we propose a new computational framework of integrating text mining and bibliometrics to provide a mapping of journal sets. Two different approaches of hybrid clustering methods are applied in this paper. The first category is ensemble clustering, which combines different clustering results obtained from individual data into a consolidated clustering result. The second category is kernel fusion, which maps heterogeneous data sets into the kernel space and combines the kernel matrices for clustering. Kernels can be combined either averagely, or by an optimized weighted linear combination model. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive kernel K-means clustering algorithm to combine textual content and citation information for clustering. The proposed algorithm is systematically compared with other methods on a clustering problem of 1869 journals published in 2002-2006. Based on several validation indices, the experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid clustering strategy is able to provide clustering result as well as the best individual data source.},

abstract={Bibliometric methods may be used to study the impact of a field, the impact of certain trends and researchers within that field, and of course the impact of particular research articles. This is no different for the field of lexicography, and the output of both metalexicographers and dictionary makers alike is increasingly being measured and quantified. Analysing such data enables one (a) to track the growing and waning popularity of certain lexicographic sub-fields, (b) to pinpoint the new directions heralded by specific lexicographic papers or by new types of dictionaries, and (c) to map the lexicographic schools of thought that have formed around some of the pioneering or most productive scholars. In this article, bibliometrics in lexicography are investigated by taking the International Journal of Lexicography as the centre piece. In the first half of the article, various bibliometric tools relevant to lexicography are introduced, and in the second half these tools are used to show that lexicography has truly become an independent discipline. In the process, comparisons are also made with two other lexicographic journals (Dictionaries and Lexikos), as well as with two journals from other disciplines (Linguistics and Applied Linguistics). © 2009 Oxford University Press.

abstract={Scientific performance is often evaluated by bibliometric indicators such as publication counts or citations. But this may neglect other relevant outputs from research units. An optimal evaluation would measure each dimension separately, but this would be costly. Luckily, cluster analyses show that units which specialise in other types of research activities (such as knowledge transfer or education of doctoral students), do not completely ignore publication-related activities. Publication-related outputs can also be disaggregated into quality (measured by citations) and quantity (measured by counts) dimensions. Thus, the performance of research groups can be screened using the Integral Citation (a new bibliometric indicator) which combines the quality and quantity dimensions. Units at the extremes need to be studied in more detail, to avoid measurement biases. © Beech Tree Publishing 2009.},

abstract={The growth of scientific research in recent times has needed the development and application of various indicators to help measure the importance of research for the scientific community. In the training of general practitioners and medical's resident, there is often a lack or deficit in handling issues concerning the production, management and publication of scientific information, these issues leads to loss of ideas an projects, which are in many libraries and research labs of universities, waiting to become part of the intellectual development in training or to contribute knowledge beyond the scientific and medical community worldwide. One of the main issues of vital importance to anyone interested in the scientific output, research result in medical journals indexed on databases, which determine the quality of work, is their access as a source of truthful information or as a means of publication; this is of great importance to Bibliometrics. It is tangible and objective to makes the quality and quantity of scientific production to necessary use bibliometrics as a tool to achieve a measurable outcome of the scientific literature. Therefore, a revision is made in the medical literature on the importance of bibliometrics, its history, its concepts and applications, in addition to its technical and bibliometric indicators in order to illustrate and provide incentives to doctors in training to understand the world of production and scientific publication.},

abstract={This paper explores the different sources to be used for the purposes of technology forecasting using bibliometrics. The Technology Life Cycle Indicators are taken as a starting point, for they take the whole life cycle into account and point to indicators for the different phases of this cycle. Two indicators were tested: the applied research phase, indicated by the number of hits in databases such as the Engineering Index; and the application phase, indicated by the number of hits on News Abstracts Daily. The latter indicator demonstrated unexpectedly early activity compared to the engineering source. The news source was then looked at in more detail and divided into news categories. Of the different news categories, "magazines and journals" showed an early appearance, and "newswires" and "blogs" a late booming activity. Overall, the results showed that the sources in the business environment should be looked at more broadly, as there is information available from various sources already early in the technology's life cycle. © 2009 PICMET.},

abstract={Despite the increasing number and diversity of publications related to soil erosion in Brazil and throughout the world, the central questions of this science remain unanswered. The possible reasons for this imbalance highlight the need to reconsider the role of research on soil erosion. Bibliometric studies can provide ample view of the research field, describing perspectives, but research using this approach is scarce in international as well as in Brazilian literature. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial, temporal, institutional and topical distribution of Brazilian research on accelerated soil erosion based on the organization of articles according to thematic lines and to discuss the depth of the approach to the fundamental issues of erosion in order to establish a bibliometric perspective. For this purpose, 225 articles of Brazilian institutions focused on soil erosion were scanned, registered in a database and classified into five thematic lines. Besides, multi-temporal maps were drawn using GIS tools. Brazilian research on erosion is recent and is characterized by: (a) concentration in few institutions in the southern and southeastern Brazil, (b) focused on two issues, related to the Universal Soil Loss Equation and comparisons of agricultural managements as related to soil loss, with a considerable influence of the consolidation level of the research centers, which have developed research on accelerated soil erosion along these two lines.},

abstract={Library and Information Science (LIS) literature mirrors the development of the LIS profession, which needs to be analyzed for growth of the profession and to overcome its weaknesses. Bibliometric methods have been widely used in LIS research for analysis of literature. This study aims to review use of bibliometrics in LIS research. It concludes that bibliometrics has been found to be very useful in solving diverse issues. However, its application to LIS literature is not very common in Pakistan and this area of research needs attention. It recommends provision of better access to literature, comprehensive bibliographical control and sharing of best practices to enhance the use of bibliometrics in LIS research.},

abstract={Purpose: To identify chronologic trends and characteristics, and to gain some insights into the future direction of the Korean Journal of Urology (KJU), all articles published in the KJU over the past 5 decades were analyzed. Materials and Methods: The bibliometric data of the entire 6,730 articles published in the KJU were classified according to publication type (original articles, review articles, case reports), publication content (experimental articles, clinical articles), and 8 genitourinary fields: oncology, voiding dysfunction/female urology, endourology/urolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UTI), sexual dysfunction/infertility, pediatric urology, trauma, and medical/miscellaneous. The data were analyzed in the following chronological order: 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Results: The number of articles published in the KJU has continuously increased annually. The proportion of original articles, which constituted 72.9% of articles overall, significantly increased in the 2000s (79.5%). Articles in the field of oncology constituted the largest proportion (37.6%) of total articles. The oncology and voiding dysfunction/female urology fields showed an increasing trend, but the UTI field showed a decreasing trend. The fields of sexual dysfunction/infertility and voiding dysfunction/ female urology began to increase in the 1990s. The percentage of experimental articles, which was 8.4% in the 1970s, and 9.0% in the 1980s, increased to 20.4% in the 1990s. Recently, the KJU was registered in some international journal databases in recognition of its scientific excellence. Conclusions: These results make up an index reflecting academic and practicing performances in urology. We hope that the KJU will soon be recognized as one of the high-quality international peer-reviewed journals. © The Korean Urological Association, 2009.},

abstract={To understand the current situation and developmental trend of anthelmintics in English journals through a bibliometric analysis. The literature was searched in Pubmed Database (1997-2007) using the following key words: "drug therapy", "anthelmintics", "humans", "pharmacology", and "parasitology". Access Database was constructed by relative literature through proper data admission method. The relative articles in the database were sorted by different categories, such as "research categories", "publishing year" and "research drug". Data were analyzed by using SPSS software. The annual number of anthelmintics articles increased steadily from year 1997 to 2007. The average number of annual increase was about 6. The major research category was applied research. The major diseases were schistosomiasis, filariasis, ascariasis, echinococcosis and hookworm disease. The number of articles on schistosomiasis was higher than that of other four diseases (P<0.05). The major drugs involved were albendazole, praziquantel, mebendazole, ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine. Articles on the anthelmintics were published mostly in medical journals. From the total database, articles published at the top five journals occupied 5.52%, 4.39%, 3.76%, 3.26%, and 3.26%, respectively. Increasingly importance has been attached to anthelmintics in the last decade. Meanwhile, the researchers focused on a few anthelmintics, and it is inevitable to develop new drugs.},

The indicators and qualitative parameters obtained show the value of performing citation analysis in cultural and linguistic areas that are poorly covered by the A&HCI.

abstract={Purpose: This article aims to show the application of scientometrics and patent bibliometrics in remaining useful life (RUL) analysis for evaluating the value of intangible assets. Design/methodology/approach: Technology innovation management is strictly related to the RUL. The RUL concept is defined as the time remaining until the reliability drops below a defined minimal operating threshold. The RUL analysis of certain intangible assets (patents and know-how licence agreements, industrial designs, trade marks, logos, customer base) is done through different methodologies and various different approaches. The key subject in all these methodologies is the life cycle of the technology. The analyst tries to approach the foresight of the life cycle of technology to establish its value in use. Different life measure systems are considered in RUL analysis depending on different typologies of technology life: statutory, contract, judicial, economic and functional. Data used in life cycle estimation may be used in RUL analysis. Typically, these data include scientific articles, registration documents (patent applications, trade marks and copyright applications), commercial contracts, judicial orders, financial statements and technology data. Findings: The analysis of the life cycle allows the incorporation of qualitative considerations (legal, contractual, physical, technical know-how, functional, economic) related to the conduct of future technologies. But technology development is conditioned by trends in scientific research and by the changes in the marketing dynamic, today and in the future. Qualitative methods provide a valuable information service that relates to the intangible assets over time. The "typical survivor curve" shows the released, remaining and probable life span of a certain technology by taking into account factors such as technological changes, marketing acceptance, and other exogenous and endogenous factors. Quantitative analysis of scientific production, applications for patents, industrial designs and trade marks, developed in scientometrics and bibliometrics, provide an unbiased guide to R&D and business trends. Originality/value: The original purpose of the paper is to emphasise how the technology life cycle is influenced by changes in technology but also in scientific research evolution. Scientific research life analysis must examine the historical emergence or decay of a certain intellectual interest in the scientific community through the study of what is and what is not published in scientific journals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Objectives: This study evaluates malaria vaccine research carried out in different parts of the world during 1972-2004 using different bibliometric indicators. Method: Data have been downloaded from PubMed for the period 1972-2004 using the keywords (malaria* or plasmodium or falciparum) and (vaccine*) in the title and abstract fields. The study examined the pattern of growth of the output, its geographical distribution, profile of different countries in different subfields and pattern of citations using GOOGLE Scholar. Results: Malaria vaccine research output is gradually increasing. The USA, followed by the UK and Australia contributed the highest number of papers. Publication activity has decreased in Switzerland and Sweden, but has increased in Brazil and China. The majority of the countries have focused on the development of asexual blood stage malaria. Citations per paper and incidence of high-quality papers for the USA, the UK, Papua New Guinea and Denmark are more than the average. The majority of the prolific institutions are located in the USA, the UK, France and Australia. Conclusion: The last two decades have witnessed considerable growth in research output in this field, while a successful malaria vaccine still remains elusive. Interestingly, the countries like the USA, the UK and Australia that lead in the quantity, quality and citation of this output are often not those directly affected by malaria. © 2009 Health Libraries Group.},

abstract={Nurses are being pressured to integrate standardized nursing terminology into the electronic health record to enable the representation and evaluation of nursing practice. Five terminology sets are recognized by the American Nurses Association that contain terms to represent nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and intervention: CCC, ICNP, NANDA/NOC/NIC, Omaha System, and PNDS. Key criteria for choosing the most suitable include demonstrated use and testing under real-time clinical conditions, scope of terms, cost, and the administrative infrastructure to sustain and evolve the terminology. Likelihood of survival is also critical and was evaluated here by examining the diffusion pattern of each terminology set through bibliometric analysis. Each of the five sets had a unique diffusion pattern, with NANDA/NOC/NIC demonstrating the most extensive penetration and author network in the CINAHL literature examined from 1982 to 2006.

abstract={Research assessment in the UK has evolved over a quarter of a century from a loosely structured, peer-review based process to one with a well understood data portfolio and assessment methodology. After 2008, the assessment process will shift again, to the use of indicators based largely on publication and citation data. These indicators will in part follow the format introduced in 2008, with a profiling of assessment outcomes at national and international levels. However, the shift from peer assessment to a quantitative methodology raises critical issues about which metrics are appropriate and informative and how such metrics should be managed to produce weighting factors for funding formulae. The link between publication metrics and other perceptions of research quality needs to be thoroughly tested and reviewed, and may be variable between disciplines. Many of the indicators that drop out of publication data are poorly linked to quality and should not be used at all. There are also issues about which publications are the correct base for assessment, which staff should be included in a review, how subjects should be structured and how the citation data should be normalised to account for discipline-dependent variables. Finally, it is vital to consider the effect that any assessment process will have on the behaviour of those to be assessed. © L. Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, 2009.},

abstract={Have you ever seen the Citation Indexes (CIs) for the year 1600? At that time, a very active community was working on the reconstruction of planetary movements by means of epicycles. In principle, any ellipse around the Sun may be approximated by sufficiently many epicycles around the Earth. This is a non-trivial geometrical task, especially given the lack of analytical tools (sums of series). And the books and papers of many talented geometers quoted one another. Scientific knowledge, however, was already taking other directions. Science has a certain "inertia", it is prudent (at times, it has been exceedingly so, mostly for political or metaphysical reasons), but even under the best of conditions, we all know how difficult it is to accept new ideas, to let them blossom in time, away from short-term pressures. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Soil science history studies are rare and the Brazilian scientific community has not given substantial attention to this subject yet. The present study focused on the formation of research on accelerated soil erosion in the Brazil from a bibliometric perspective. A comprehensive database of published scientific papers was organized in a relational database and analyzed by SQL queries and GIS tools. These data were used to calculate quantitative indicators and spatial distribution patterns. Results indicate a recent development of research on accelerated soil erosion in Brazil by few institutions and authors in the South and Southeast regions. Moreover, a thematic analysis indicated the agricultural perspective as the main focus of erosion studies, with a great emphasis on the USLE prediction model.},

abstract={The use of outcome control modes of research evaluation exercises is ever more frequent. They are conceived as tools to stimulate increased levels of research productivity, and to guide choices in allocating components of government research budgets for publicly funded institutions. There are several contributions in the literature that compare the different methodological approaches that policy makers could adopt for these exercises, however the comparisons are limited to only a few disciplines. This work, examining the case of the whole of the "hard sciences" of the Italian academic system, makes a comparison between results obtained from peer review type of evaluations (as adopted by the Ministry of Universities and Research) and those possible from a bibliometric approach (as developed by the authors). The aim is to understand to what extent bibliometric methodology, which is noted as relatively inexpensive, time-saving and exhaustive, can complement and integrate peer review methodology in research evaluation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a method for bibliometric evaluation of individuals, i.e. research staff currently employed within a university department or other knowledge organisations with research purposes. Based on methods for citation analysis and methods for clustering of papers into research lines (using bibliographic coupling) we present an analysis of one researcher in three dimensions: 1) publication and citation indicators; 2) publication profile, and 3) research lines. One of the features of the method is the benchmark against other researchers within the same research line, i.e. researchers that use the same references and, accordingly, are active in the same field of research. The paper suggests this method as a means to avoid the fallacies of evaluation solely dependent on sub-field categories in the Web of Science in advanced citation analysis. The method was used in a Research Assessment Exercise accomplished in the autumn of 2008 at Royal Institute of Technology.},

abstract={The success of the organization of an international conference depends in a big extent on a considerable number of controversial decisions. Many of them are taken considering expert opinions, but some others are still based on more or less subjective criteria. In this study, we suggest and document that the inclusion of bibliometric and scientometric methods does not only facilitate the organization of a conference but also contribute to support and legitimate the decisions taken by its organizers. Bibliometric indicators and methods improve the quality of the selection process and introduce a broader view for the application of consolidated criteria. Additionally, mapping techniques appear as very adequate instruments for the assignment of contributions to the reviewers and for the compilation of the sessions resulting in the final programme. Finally, we recommend their use in the organization of conferences independent of their subject.},

abstract={Bibliometric analysis is an important tool in the management of a journal. SCOPUS output is used to assess the increase in the quantity of material in Atmospheric Environment and stylistic changes in the way authors choose words and punctuation in titles and assemble their reference lists. Citation analysis is used to consider the impact factor of the journal, but perhaps more importantly the way in which it reflects the importance authors give to papers published in Atmospheric Environment. The impact factor of Atmospheric Environment (2.549 for 2007) from the Journal Citation Reports suggests it performs well within the atmospheric sciences, but it conceals the long term value authors place on papers appearing in the journal. Reference lists show that a fifth come through citing papers more than a decade old. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The publications in scientometrics with Brazilian authorship expanded exponentially in the 1990-2006 period, reaching 13 times in the Web of Science database and 19.5 times in the Google Scholar database. This increase is rather superior to that of the total Brazilian scientific production in the same time period. Some characteristics to be noticed in this rise are: (1) the total number of articles during this period was 197; in that, 78% were published in 57 Brazilian journals and 22% in 13 international journals; (2) the national and international articles averaged 4.3 and 5.9 citations/article, respectively. Two journals stood out among these - The national Ciência da Informação and the international Scientometrics; (3) the articles encompass an impressive participation of authors from areas other than information science. The occurrence of adventitious authors at this level of multidisciplinarity is uncommon in science. However, the possible benefits of such pattern are not clear in view of a fragmented intercommunication among the authors, as noticed by the citations. The advantages of improving the intercommunicability among authors and of using other scientometric and bibliometric databases, such as SciELO, to avoid an almost exclusive use of the Web of Science database, are discussed.},

abstract={We present a new application of bibliometrics, Literature-based Multidiscipline Knowledge Discovery (LMKD), which is quite different from the well known literature-based knowledge discovery method given by Don R. Swanson. The goal of LMKD is to discover new, potentially meaningful academic visions and relations among given disciplines, by mining bibliographic databases (here we take the case of CSSCI). By using LMKD method, we can try to find the similarities and differences between two research regions and the nature of the disciplines' relationship will be known clearly. As a discovery method, LMKD can be used in a more widely research area than other literature-based discovery methods.},

abstract={As bibliometric indicators are objective, reliable and cost-effective measures of peer-reviewed research outputs, they are expected to play an increasingly important role in research assessment as well as in the management of research, including supporting the selection of projects eligible to receive financial support. This paper presents the results of a project where bibliometrics was used as a performance measurement tool to supplement the evaluation of the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) funding program. The following questions were addressed: (1) Has the NCIC peer-review process been successful in selecting outstanding Canadian researchers in cancer research? (2) Has NCIC funding contributed to increasing the scientific performance of the papers authored by the researchers it supported? (3) How do NCIC-supported researchers compare to their US counterparts that received support from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI)? Citation analysis data provide evidence that the NCIC supported scientists who stand out among Canadian cancer researchers and that NCIC funding had a positive effect on the scientific impact of papers authored by the researchers it supported. Results also show that, although NCIC researchers have less scientific impact than NCI researchers, they are more cited than the US and Canadian average.},

abstract={Due to the uncertainty of emerging technologies development and their commercial prospect, it has important significant for technology investment decision-making on how to judge the prospect of emerging technology commercialization. Through the introduction on the relationship of bibliometrics and industry development, at first, this paper illuminates that it is a good method to research the emerging technology commercial prospect by using bibliometrics analysis methodology; then, the degree of emerging technology approaching to commercialization is illustrated by judging the technology maturity, at last, the degree of emerging technology approaching to commercialization success is analysis by judging whether the environment has being ready based on bibliometrics analysis approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Bibliometric research has risen in popularity during recent years and an increasing number of investigations now have examined the nursing literature. Our article provides a comprehensive overview of citation-based research in the nursing profession, as well as a discussion of bibliometrics, journal impact factors, and international publishing trends. The debate on evidence-based practice and its potential influence and relevance for nursing scholars is also covered. Although journal performance indicators are, no doubt, important for the contemporary nursing academic, it is the core research skills and attributes that nursing scholars, academics, and educators will need to consider more carefully in future if the next generation of professional nurse researchers is to truly flourish. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

abstract={Although the fields of bibliometrics and citation analysis have existed for many years, relatively few studies have specifically focused on the dermatological literature. This article reviews citation-based research in the dermatology journals, with a particular interest in manuscripts that have included Contact Dermatitis as part of their analysis. Overall, it can be seen that the rise of bibliometrics during the mid-20th century and its subsequent application to dermatology has provided an interesting insight into the progression of research within our discipline. Further investigation of citation trends and top-cited papers in skin research periodicals would certainly help complement the current body of knowledge. © 2008 The Author.},

abstract={Bibliometrics has changed out of all recognition since 1958; becoming established as a field, being taught widely in library and information science schools, and being at the core of a number of science evaluation research groups around the world. This was all made possible by the work of Eugene Garfield and his Science Citation Index. This article reviews the distance that bibliometrics has travelled since 1958 by comparing early bibliometrics with current practice, and by giving an overview of a range of recent developments, such as patent analysis, national research evaluation exercises, visualization techniques, new applications, online citation indexes, and the creation of digital libraries. Webometrics, a modern, fast-growing offshoot of bibliometrics, is reviewed in detail. Finally, future prospects are discussed with regard to both bibliometrics and webometrics. © CILIP.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the way in which library and information science (LIS) issues have been handled in the formulation of recent UK Higher Education policy concerned with research quality evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - A chronological review of decision making about digital rights arrangements for the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), and of recent announcements about the new shape of metrics-based assessment in the Research Excellence Framework, which supersedes the RAE. Against this chronological framework, the likely nature of LIS practitioner reactions to the flow of decision making is suggested. Findings - It was found that a weak grasp of LIS issues by decision makers undermines the process whereby effective research evaluation models are created. LIS professional opinion should be sampled before key decisions are made. Research limitations/implications - This paper makes no sophisticated comments on the complex research issues underlying advanced bibliometric research evaluation models. It does point out that sophisticated and expensive bibliometric consultancies arrive at many conclusions about metrics-based research assessment that are common knowledge amongst LIS practitioners. Practical implications - Practical difficulties arise when one announces a decision to move to a new and specific type of research evaluation indicator before one has worked out anything very specific about that indicator. Originality/value - In this paper, the importance of information management issues to the mainstream issues of government and public administration is underlined. The most valuable conclusion of this paper is that, because LIS issues are now at the heart of democratic decision making, LIS practitioners and professionals should be given some sort of role in advising on such matters.},

abstract={Technology has become a decisive factor for technology-intensive companies because of its significant influence on product development and process optimization. It is important to identify advantages or barriers of technologies, to compare them as well as to analyze the probability of being substituted. Therefore, scientific researchers and decision-makers in companies address their attention to technology intelligence, which is the sum of methods, processes, best practices, and tools used to identify business-sensitive information about technological developments or trends that can influence a company's competitive position. The technology intelligence process strides across four levels: data, information, knowledge, and decisions. Data are symbols with no meaning. Information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection. Knowledge is the output of scouting, processing, and analyzing information. Decisions are made on the basis of knowledge [4]. Within the framework of technology intelligence, the main task is to procure accurate information about performances and developments of technologies, that is, to identify technology indicators. Technology indicators are those indexes or statistical data that allow direct characterization and evaluation of technologies throughout their whole lifecycles, for example, technological maturity, market segment, degree of innovation, or key player (country, company, ... ). Those technology indicators offer a direct view of technologies to decisionmakers. People usually read documents one by one and collect the key information manually. But, the amount of information has dramatically increased in recent years. It is no longer possible to evaluate or characterize technologies by reading documents. Therefore, there is a demand for methods that support technology intelligence by systematically analyzing documents for the purpose of extraction of information relevant to technology indicators. One of the methods, which fulfils the requirements, is bilbiometrics. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Australia is about to move to a new system of distributing government block grants for research among universities, with the introduction of a process similar to Britain's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). One of the most significant departures from the current RAE model is that, in the Australian Research Quality Framework, peer judgements will be informed by quantitative performance measures, including bibliometrics. The data will not be used in any formulaic way, but will sit alongside the assessment of other information provided to discipline panels - contextual information provided by the groups being assessed, the full text of the publications they regard as their 'best', and a full list of publications produced in the assessment period. This paper details the metrics to be used in this new framework and outlines some of the reasons why a balanced approach to research assessment was adopted. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether publications of importance for improving the health system and its technologies are highly cited intrascientifically. Methods: Bibliometric assessment of the 596 publications used as sources in the fifty SBU Alerts from 2001to 2004 from the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care was carried out using the Thomson Scientific citation indexes. Normalized citation scores were calculated for all included studies. Additional factors such as the time and place of the research, subject categories, and journal source were analyzed. Results: On average, the sources in SBU Alert have been cited eight times more than the world average consistently during the time period and across research areas. Articles used as its scientific basis are often published in a few, high impact, general medical journals. However, many of the articles are published in field-specific journals with low impact factors. Most articles used in SBU Alert are published by authors based in the United States or the United Kingdom. However, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch publications are overrepresented in its science base, whereas Japanese, Taiwanese, Indian, and Russian publications are underrepresented. Conclusions: Publications used as sources in a Swedish system for identification and early assessment of new methods in health care are also highly cited within the scientific community. This finding increases the appropriateness of using bibliometric indicators in evaluations of clinical research and suggests that decision makers through SBU Alert are getting scientifically sound advice. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Technology is the vital factor for technology-based companies because of its decisive impact on companies' competitive position. Therefore, Technology Intelligence is a crucial topic, which is characterized from the perspective of strategic information management as identifying, analyzing, and evaluating innovations of technologies. One of the methods that support Technology Intelligence is Bibliometrics, which is devoted tp the quantitative analysis of literature by statistical means. Bibliometric research is most often used in the field of library science; it has also wide applications in other areas. In this paper, a Bibliometrics-based methodology is proposed, which aims at improving the acquisition processes in the context of Technology Intelligence. Following the methodology, all the necessary information is firstly collected and filtered through information retrieval. Secondly and most importantly, bibliometric analysis is used to summarize the retrieved information and to figure out the possible technology indicators, which characterize the development of technologies and their potential benefits. After expert consultations, the final technology indicators are identified and assigned with indicator values. The methodology is concretely explained via a case study. The methodology is embedded in the Technology Management System, which was developed by the Heinz Nixdorf Institute. The rest of this paper is devoted to the introduction of this Technology Management System.},

abstract={This study has as its objective to identify the scientific studies dealing with the orientation to patients submitted to ostomy published between 1970 to 2004 and to classify them according to quantity, chronology of publication, authors' function, source, kind of study, topic, origin and key words by using the bibliometrics methodology. A total of 27 publications were collected in the DEDALUS databank, in the LILACS and MEDLINE databases and from a professor of the University of São Paulo's Nursing School (EEUSP, which is a national reference in ostomy in Brazil). Of these, 19 were written by Brazilians and 8 by non-Brazilians; most were written by nurses and enterostomal therapists. Dissertations, theses, orientation manuals, books and articles were found. The origin of the material was academia, laboratories and hospitals. The 1990s concentrated the largest number of studies in this thematic area. All of them have the purpose of elevating patients' self-esteem in order to make them feel that, even with an ostomy, they can have a normal life. Thus the study concludes that the nurse, as an educator for the ostomy patient, should be acquainted with those publications to improve the assistance he/she provides.},

abstract={Advances in technology are the vital factor of competitiveness for technology-intensive companies. Therefore, an intelligent system is required to procure information relevant to technologies. However, the information amount has been dramatically increased. It is no longer possible to analyse the information manually. A methodology to improve the acquisition processes for the identification of technology indicators, which characterise and evaluate technologies, is proposed. This methodology is embedded in the innovative Technology Database developed by Heinz Nixdorf Institute. Decision makers can be well informed about advances in technologies by technology reports and technology roadmaps, which are automatically generated from the database. © 2007, Inderscience Publishers.},

METHODS: By means of bibliometrics, clinical acupuncture study literatures from 1978 to 2004, searched from CBM database, were sorted and counted to show the different clinical utilizing quantities and developing trends of different disease groups in the acupuncture clinic. RESULTS: Obviously dominant type: nervous system diseases; mature type: motor system diseases; developing type: 3 kind of diseases including psychosis; premature type: diseases related with surgery; steady type: 3 kind of diseases including digestive system diseases (diseases of liver and gallbladder are not included); pre-developing diseases: 5 kind of diseases including otorhinolaryngologic diseases. CONCLUSION: Among all these types, obvious advantage type and mature type are the most distinguishing. Developing type has the most significant ascending trend. Premature type has relatively strong developing potentiality.},

abstract={In Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the ratio Cognitive Effects/Processing Effort defines the relevance of a communication. The tf*idf formula from information retrieval is used to operatlonalize this ratio for any item co-occurring with a user-supplied seed term in bibliometric distributions. The tf weight of the item predicts its effect on the user in the context of the seed term, and Its idf weight predicts the user's processing effort in relating the item to the seed term. The idf measure, also known as statistical specificity, is shown to have unsuspected applications in quantifying interrelated concepts such as topical and nontopical relevance, levels of user expertise, and levels of authority. A new kind of visualization, the pennant diagram, illustrates these claims. The bibliometric distributions visualized are the works cocited with a seed work (Moby Dick), the authors cocited with a seed author (White HD, for maximum interpretability), and the books and articles cocited with a seed article (S.A. Harter's "Psychological Relevance and Information Science," which introduced RT to information scientists in 1992). Pennant diagrams use bibliometric data and information retrieval techniques on the system side to mimic a relevance-theoretic model of cognition on the user side. Relevance theory may thus influence the design of new visual information retrieval interfaces. Generally, when information retrieval and bibliometrics are interpreted in light of RT, the implications are rich: A single sociocognitive theory may serve to integrate research on literature-based systems with research on their users, areas now largely separate.},

abstract={When bibliometric data are converted to term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf) values, plotted as pennant diagrams, and interpreted according to Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the results evoke major variables of information science (IS). These include topicality, in the sense of intercohesion and intercoherence among texts; cognitive effects of texts in response to people's questions; people's levels of expertise as a precondition for cognitive effects; processing effort as textual or other messages are received; specificity of terms as it affects processing effort; relevance, defined in RT as the effects/effort ratio; and authority of texts and their authors. While such concerns figure automatically in dialogues between people, they become problematic when people create or use or judge literature-based information systems. The difficulty of achieving worthwhile cognitive effects and acceptable processing effort in human-system dialogues explains why relevance is the central concern of IS. Moreover, since relevant communication with both systems and unfamiliar people is uncertain, speakers tend to seek cognitive effects that cost them the least effort. Yet hearers need greater effort, often greater specificity, from speakers if their responses are to be highly relevant in their turn. This theme of mismatch manifests itself in vague reference questions, underdeveloped online searches, uncreative judging in retrieval evaluation trials, and perfunctory indexing. Another effect of least effort is a bias toward topical relevance over other kinds. RT can explain these outcomes as well as more adaptive ones. Pennant diagrams, applied here to a literature search and a Bradford-style journal analysis, can model them. Given RT and the right context, bibliometrics may predict psychometrics.},

abstract={Bibliometric techniques applied to a narrow topic of linguistics show that a synthesis of specific and general levels of analysis might be appropriate for a non-specialist investigating applied language problems. Citation frequency, ages and half-lives of cited works, co-citation analysis, and source impact were applied to literature on the topic "Finnish grammatical noun case distribution." The analyses were applied to works from a bibliography, which were chosen on the basis of their usefulness to help the foreign-language learner regarding this specific problem of Finnish. The citation-frequency counts reflect Lotka's Law. Many frequently cited authors were not predicted to be highly relevant, based on selection procedures for the bibliography. The PI reflects a soft science. High co-citation counts predicted high citation frequency, but the inverse was not true. Highly cited authors were mapped and clustered using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering in SPSS. The x-axis and some clusters predicted a few general properties. The topic's literature does not approach the degree of descriptive adequacy required by the hard sciences and thus continues to draw considerable support from classical authors of works on general syntax and Finnish syntax.

abstract={It is rather difficult to forecast emerging technologies as there is no historical data available. In such cases, the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis have provided useful data. This paper presents the forecasts for three emerging technology areas by integrating the use of bibliometrics and patent analysis into well-known technology forecasting tools such as scenario planning, growth curves and analogies. System dynamics is also used to be able to model the dynamic ecosystem of the technologies and their diffusion. Technologies being forecasted are fuel cell, food safety and optical storage technologies. Results from these three applications help us to validate the proposed methods as appropriate tools to forecast emerging technologies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The identification of the scientific production and the evaluation of the researchers is a problem we are facing at present times. Bibliometric methods use mainly statistical tools and their results are of quantitative nature. Consequently, this approach does not provide any tools of qualitative evaluation. It is for this reason we suggest to examine the specific details of the bibliographic references in the texts. This linguistic approach, which uses the contextual exploration method, allows us to annotate automatically the text and thus to propose a new way to address this problem. The computer application of this study will be integrated into the platform EX-COM (Exploration COntexuel Multilingue).},

abstract={Among the many statistics on science, called scientometrics, bibliometrics holds a privileged place. Bibliometrics is one of the few subfields concerned with measuring the output side of science. According to most "histories", bibliometrics owes its systematic development mainly to D.J.D. Price and Eugene Garfield, as founders. The few works conducted before the 1950s are usually relegated to prehistory. This paper documents how the systematic counting of publications originated with psychologists. In the early 1900s, psychologists began collecting statistics on their discipline. Publications came to be counted in addresses, reviews and histories of psychology for several decades. The aim was to contribute to the advancement of psychology. Far from being a negligible output of a prehistoric type, both the volume and the systematicness of these efforts are witnesses to what should be considered as pioneering work, and their authors considered as forerunners to bibliometrics. copyrigtht © 2006 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

abstract={The objective of the present study is twofold: (1) to show the aims and means of quantitative interpretation of bibliographic features in bibliometrics and their re-interpretation in research policy, and (2) to summarise the state-of-art in self-citation research. The authors describe three approaches to the role of author self-citations and possible conflicts arising from the different perspectives. From the bibliometric viewpoint we can conclude that that there is no reason for condemning self-citations in general or for removing them from macro or meso statistics; supplementary indicators based on self-citations are, nonetheless, useful to understand communication patterns.

abstract={Over the past few years, data mining has moved from corporations to other organizations. This paper looks at the integration of data mining in digital library services. First, bibliomining, or the combination of bibliometrics and data mining techniques to understand library services, is defined and the concept explored. Second, the conceptual frameworks for bibliomining from the viewpoint of the library decision-maker and the library researcher are presented and compared. Finally, a research agenda to resolve many of the common bibliomining issues and to move the field forward in a mindful manner is developed. The result is not only a roadmap for understanding the integration of data mining in digital library services, but also a template for other cross-discipline data mining researchers to follow for systematic exploration in their own subject domains. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This commentary raises significant cautions related to inherent shortcomings in the use of bibliographic analytic technology, and in particular its use in substantive decision making around promotion and tenure. Questions are raised concerning the continued use of scholarly energy for bibliometric analysis of subtly different settings. The recommendation is offered that future efforts in bibliometrics must target methods to reduce methodological shortcomings. These include clarifying the metric used to "count" sole/multiple authorship, and to evaluate the "merit" of manuscripts as well as journals in which they appear. Finally, the fundamental meaning of the information produced in these analyses (i.e., the validity of the measure) must be clearly presented in order for it to be credibly used. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={The assessment of scholarship assumes a central role in the evaluation of individual faculty, educational programs and academic fields. Because the production and assessment of scholarship is so central to the faculty role, it is incumbent upon decision makers to strive to make assessments of scholarship fair and equitable. This paper will focus on an approach to the assessment of the quantity and impact of the most important subset of an individual's scholarship-peer-reviewed journal articles. The primary goal of this paper is to stimulate discussion regarding scholarship assessment in hiring, reappointment, tenure and promotion decisions. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Bibliometrics is a field of research that examines bodies of knowledge within and across disciplines. Citation analysis, a component of bibliometrics, focuses on the quantitative assessment of citation patterns within a body of literature. Citation analysis has been used in social work to examine the quantity and the impact of the work of individuals and academic institutions. This paper presents a selective review of these uses of bibliometrics within social work. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: Urology, as other medical-surgical specialities, had its consolidation process in the mid 19th century. This phenomenon in the history of medicine occurs around certain authors, which in the case of urology in Valencia was Dr. Raphael Molla Rodrigo, and several key elements such as development of lithotripsy and cystoscopy, as cited by prestigious authors in the second national meeting of history of medicine in Salamanca in 1965. For this process a spreading media is necessary, either regional or national, (or posterior bibliometric analysis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of urological publications in the area of Valencia to know the main areas of knowledge, main authors and publications. Regarding this latter we point out Cronica medica, Revista Valenciana de Ciencias Médicas, Archivas Españoles de Urología y Policlínica. As authors, Rafael Molla Rodrigo, Victor Molla Fambuena and Rafael Alcalá Santaella stand out. Genitourinary tuberculosis and surgical procedures with their complications are among the most commonly treated topics. RESULTS: Dr. Rafael Molla Rodrigo is the author with the highest number of articles and the one who contributed to the consolidation of the speciality nationwide with his extensive scientific contributions. Genitourinary tuberculosis is extensively treated, and surgical procedures and their complications are in second place. The journal in which we were able to find more articles was Cronica Medica, due to its greater diffusion among general practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize Dr. Rafael Molla as the main author, genitourinary tuberculosis as the main topic and the journal Cronica Medica as the most commonly used media.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this article is to describe Maurice Line's continuing interest in bibliometrics and in its possible application to library problems since the 1970s. He has especially emphasized two strands. One is the concept of obsolescence and how it applies in practice. The other is citation studies of the social sciences, which tend to have been ignored in comparison with the sciences. He has particularly explored the limitations that need to be taken into account when trying to apply bibliometric ideas in practical contexts. Design/methodology/approach - An analysis of Line's publications on bibliometrics led to a selection of major themes in his writings. A subsequent study of the publications of others who wrote on this topic over the same period provided a framework for assessing his work. Findings - Maurice Line played an important role in the development of this area of bibliometrics, though he slightly modified some of his early ideas as time has passed. Originality/value - Provides a background to Maurice Line's interest in bibliometrics since the 1970s. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study examines the bibliometrics of the controversial scientific literature of Polywater research, focusing on publication types (books, journal publications, conference proceedings, and technical reports). Publication (P) frequency is used to measure publication "shape" or pattern and output, citations per publication (CPP) for impact, author self-citations (SC) and uncited publications (UP) for their effect on P and CPP. Findings show an epidemic publication pattern, journal publications with the highest P, books with the highest CPP, and insignificant SC and UP. Comparisons to several non-controversial scientific literatures suggest that these findings may be common to other controversial scientific literatures.

abstract={In order to retrieve Chinese and foreign articles of chronotherapy, we searched Chinese databases of CBM, CMCC and foreign series databases in OVID and hence revealed and assessed the current status, research trend and level of chronotherapy in China and in foreign countries by means of scientometric and bibliometric parameters. ProCite5 software and handsearching were used to manage, check and statistically analyze the searched papers so as to find the parameters which included distributions of databases, years, authors, periodicals, subject headings, organizations and nations. 91 Chinese papers were identified which were distributed in 73 kinds of journals and in subject headings, e.g., Traditional Chinese medicine, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, asthma, peptic ulcer, diabetes mellitus, general review of chronotherapy, etc. 480 foreign articles were identified which mainly came from EMBASE and MEDLINE and were distributed in 285 types of journals and 35 nations and regions. There were 14 journals which recorded five or more articles. 12 researchers published more than five articles. Paul Brousse Hospital, University of Texas, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Jichi Medical School and University of Minnesota were the core research institutes. There was no core author or core journal or core institute in China up till now. However, core authors, core journals and core research institutes had come into being in foreign countries; they were mainly from the Euro-American developed countries and had done well in chronotherapy.},

abstract={The introduction of bibliometric (and other) ranking is an answer to legitimation pressures on the higher education and research system. After years of hesitation by scientists, science administrators and even politicians in many of the industrialized countries, the implementation of bibliometrics based (and other types of) rankings for institutions of higher education and research is now being introduced on a full scale. What used to be an irritation to the parties concerned has suddenly become a fad. In contrast to this rather sudden enthusiasm, there is very little reflection on the impacts of this practice on the system itself. So far empirical data on the impact of bibliometric rankings seem to be available only for two cases: Australia and the British research assessment exercise (RAE). Thus, the actual steering effects of bibliometric rankings, the reactions of the system are largely unknown. Rankings are in urgent demand by politics. The intended effect is to create competition among institutions of higher learning and research and thereby to increase their efficiency. The rankings are supposed to identify excellence in these institutions and among researchers. Unintended effects may be "oversteering", either by forcing less competitive institutions to be closed down or by creating oligopolies whose once achieved position of supremacy cannot be challenged anymore by competitors. On the individual level the emergence of a kind of 'chart' of highly cited stars in science can already be observed (ISI HighlyCited.com). With the spread of rankings the business administration paradigm and culture is diffused through the academic system. The commercialization of ranking is most pronounced in the dependence of the entire practice on commercial providers of the pertinent data. As products like ISI's Essential Science Indicators become available, their use in the context of evaluation tasks is increasing rapidly. The future of the higher education and research system rests on two pillars: traditional peer review and ranking. The goal must be to have a system of informed peer review which combines the two. However, the politicized use of numbers (citations, impact factors, funding etc.) appears unavoidable. Copyright © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Database Tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multi-word phrase frequencies and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multiword technical phrases) from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities of the expert human analyst. DT was used to derive technical intelligence from a Power Sources database derived from the Science Citation Index. Phrase frequency analysis by the technical domain experts provided the pervasive technical themes of the Power Sources database, and the phrase proximity analysis provided the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. Bibliometric analysis of the Power Sources literature supplemented the DT results with author/journal/institution/country publication and citation data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The paper introduces bibliometrics to the research area of knowledge organization - more precisely in relation to construction and maintenance of thesauri. As such, the paper reviews related work that has been of inspiration for the assembly of a semi-automatic, bibliometric-based, approach for construction and maintenance. Similarly, the paper discusses the methodical considerations behind the approach. Eventually, the semi-automatic approach is used to verify the applicability of bibliometric methods as a supplement to construction and maintenance of thesauri. In the context of knowledge organization, the paper outlines two fundamental approaches to knowledge organization, that is, the manual intellectual approach and the automatic algorithmic approach. Bibliometric methods belong to the automatic algorithmic approach, though bibliometrics do have special characteristics that are substantially different from other methods within this approach.},

abstract={The digitization of back issues of print journals creates opportunities - for bibliometric analysis using the electronic text files. Using readily available software, simple methods, and a little creativity, librarians can extract and manipulate information from database search results and from digitized journals for analysis of publication and citation behavior. The current study describes methods and results from a bibliometric and citation analysis of the electronic version of the Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science. This study illustrates the opportunities as well as the challenges for bibliometrics and citation analysis in the electronic environment. As more journals migrate to the digital environment, issues of access, copyright and fair use, online file formats, and idiosyncrasies in the digital files may limit the opportunities for bibliometric analysis. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract={Database Tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multi-word phrase frequencies and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multi-word technical phrases) from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities of the expert human analyst. DT was used to obtain technical intelligence from a Fractals database derived from the Science Citation Index/Social Science Citation Index (SCI). Phrase frequency analysis by the technical domain experts provided the pervasive technical themes of the Fractals database, and the phrase proximity analysis provided the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. Bibliometric analysis of the Fractals literature supplemented the DT results with author/journal/institution publication and citation data.},

DT was used to derive technical intelligence from a Nonlinear Dynamics database derived from the Science Citation Index/Social Science Citation Index (SCI). Phrase frequency analysis by the technical domain experts provided the pervasive technical themes of the Nonlinear Dynamics database, and the phrase proximity analysis provided the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. Bibliometric analysis of the Nonlinear Dynamics literature supplemented the DT results with author/journal/institution publication and citation data.},

abstract={This investigation was made to reveal the current status, research trend and research level of biomedical engineering in Chinese mainland by means of scientometrics and to assess the quality of the four domestic publications by bibliometrics. We identified all articles of four related publications by searching Chinese and foreign databases from 1997 to 2001. All articles collected or cited by these databases were searched and statistically analyzed for finding out the relevant distributions, including databases, years, authors, institutions, subject headings and subheadings. The source of sustentation funds and the related articles were analyzed too. The results showed that two journals were cited by two foreign databases and five Chinese databases simultaneously. The output of Journal of Biomedical Engineering was the highest. Its quantity of original papers cited by EI, CA and the totality of papers sponsored by funds were higher than those of the others, but the quantity and percentage per year of biomedical articles cited by EI were decreased in all. Inland core authors and institutions had come into being in the field of biomedical engineering. Their research topics were mainly concentrated on ten subject headings which included biocompatible materials, computer-assisted signal processing, electrocardiography, computer-assisted image processing, biomechanics, algorithms, electroencephalography, automatic data processing, mechanical stress, hemodynamics, mathematical computing, microcomputers, theoretical models, etc. The main subheadings were concentrated on instrumentation, physiopathology, diagnosis, therapy, ultrasonography, physiology, analysis, surgery, pathology, method, etc.},

abstract={Database tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multi-word phrase frequencies and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multi-word technical phrases) from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities of the expert human analyst. DT was used to derive technical intelligence from an electrochemical power database derived from the science citation index (SCI). Phrase frequency analysis by the technical domain experts provided the pervasive technical themes of the electrochemical power database, and the phrase proximity analysis provided the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. Bibliometric analysis of the electrochemical power literature supplemented the DT results with author/journal/institution publication and citation data. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which the field of bibliometrics and scientometrics makes use of sources outside the field. The research was carried out by examining the references of articles published in Scientometrics in the course of two calendar years, 1990, 2000. The results show that in 2000, 56.9% (and 47.3% in 1990) of the references originated from three fields: scientometrics and bibliometrics; library and information science; and the sociology, history and philosophy of science. When comparing the two periods, there is also a considerable increase in journal self-citation (i.e., references to the journal Scientometrics) and in the percentage of references to journals.},

abstract={India and China lead the world in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB), accounting for 23% and 17% respectively, of the global burden of the disease and hold the 15th and the 18th positions in terms of incidence per 100,000 population. But India accounts for only about 5-6% of the world's research output in this area and China a paltry 1% as seen from papers indexed in three international databases, viz. PubMed, Science Citation Index and Biochemistry and Biophysics Citation Index over the ten-year period 1990-1999. Thus there is a tremendous mismatch between the share of the burden of the disease and share of research efforts. Is such mismatch acceptable? It raises the question 'should resource-poor countries invest in research or should they depend on research performed elsewhere and invest their meagre resources predominantly in health-care measures?' We argue that both India and China should invest much more in research than they do. We have also mapped TB research in the two countries and identified institutions and cities active in research, journals used to publish the findings, use of high impact journals, impact of their research as seen from citations received and extent of international collaboration. Although China performs much less research than India and its work is quoted much less often, it seems to have done far better than India in health-care delivery in TB. Perhaps the Chinese are better able to translate know-how into do-how than the Indians.},

abstract={Viewed in the aggregate, a company's publications represent one of its greatest business assets. Can professionals in the information and communication fields help their company understand the return on its investment in publishing ? The field of bibliometrics studies publication patterns by using quantitative analysis and statistics. Bibliometrics can be either descriptive, such as looking at how many articles your organization has published, or evaluative, such as using citation analysis to look at how those articles influenced subsequent research by others. Counting publications can be useful for doing some comparisons, but citation analysis allows you to look at the impact those articles have had on others by determining how often they are cited. Citation analysis can also show what journals, organizations, and even countries have high impact in different fields of research. The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has been a leader in the citation analysis field since 1961, when ISI published the first Science Citation Index. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has been using data from ISI for both descriptive and evaluative purposes. This data is used to track what the researchers at the Laboratory are writing and then comparing research groups within the organization over a period of years to identify trends and opportunities. PNNL has also used citation analysis to explore what organizations and academic institutions are doing research in certain fields for partnering opportunities.},

abstract={Database tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multiword phrase frequencies and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multiword technical phrase) from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities of the expert human analyst. DT has been used to derive technical intelligence from a variety of textual database sources, most recently the published technical literature as exemplified by the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Engineering Compendex (EC). Phrase frequency analysis (the occurence frequency of multiword technical phrases) provides the pervasive technical themes of the topical databases of interest, and phrase proximity analysis provides the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. In the structured published literature databases, bibliometric analysis of the database records supplements the DT results by identfying: the recent most prolific topical area authors; the journals that contain numerous topical area papers; the institutions that produce numerous topical area papers; the keywords specified most frequently by the topical area authors; the authors whose works are cited most frequently in the topical area papers; and the particular papers and journals cited most frequently in the topical area papers. This review paper summarizes: (1) the theory and background development of DT; (2) past published and unpublished literature study results; (3) present application activities; (4) potential expansion to new DT applications. In addition, application of DT to technology forecasting is addressed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Electronic publishing developments and new information technology in general will affect the main functions of scientific communication. Most changes however will be primarily technological but not conceptual. Publication via journals of high reputation is in most fields of science crucial to receive professional recognition. That will remain so in the "electronic era". A much more revolutionary change in science will be the increasing availability and sharing of research data.},

abstract={The bibliometric characteristics of electronic journals (e-journals) covering the field of information science have been studied. Twenty-eight e-journals were identified and ranked by number of articles on the subject they published. A Bradford plot revealed that the core is not well developed yet, but it will likely contain six journals. The publication of information science articles in e-journals began about 1990. In 1995 (the starting date for this study), a modest 26 articles appeared, but publication has now risen to approximately 250 articles per year. The most prolific authors are identified. The vast majority of them are located in the United States or United Kingdom. Only 26 articles have authors from more than one country, showing that electronic technology has not yet strongly influenced international collaboration. About 2/3 of the articles originate in academic institutions. Common topics of e-journal articles in information science include electronic information, electronic publishing, virtual (digital) libraries, information search and retrieval, and use of the Internet. Seven online databases cover these e-journals; Information Science Abstracts is the only one to cover all 28 journals, and it has the highest number of abstracts from them - over 1,100.},

abstract={Since Vassily V. Nalimov coined the term 'scientometrics' in the 1960s, this term has grown in popularity and is used to describe the study of science: growth, structure, interrelationships and productivity. Scientometrics is related to and has overlapping interests with bibliometrics and informetrics. The terms bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics refer to component fields related to the study of the dynamics of disciplines as reflected in the production of their literature. Areas of study range from charting changes in the output of a scholarly field through time and across countries, to the library collection problem of maintaining control of the output, and to the low publication productivity of most researchers. These terms are used to describe similar and overlapping methodologies. The origins and historical survey of the development of each of these terms are presented. Profiles of the usage of each of these terms over time are presented, using an appropriate subject category of databases on the DIALOG information service. Various definitions of each of the terms are provided from an examination of the literature. The size of the overall literature of these fields is determined and the growth and stabilisation of both the dissertation and non-dissertation literature are shown. A listing of the top journals in the three fields are given, as well as a list of the major reviews and bibliographies that have been published over the years.},

abstract={Background. Spain is one of the few European countries to have recently totally incorporated the study of nursing into the university sector. Bibliometric studies may be of a great help for the consolidation of nursing research. Aim of the study. The aim of this paper is to describe bibliographic references in Spanish nursing research papers and their evolution over a decade. Method. The method consists of a retrospective bibliometric study of a sample (cluster sampling) of 622 research papers (original papers and review papers), which were contained in the Spanish nursing journals Enfermería Científica, Revista ROL de Enfermería, Enfermería Clínica and Enfermería Integral, and published from 1985 to 1994. The journal Nursing Research was selected for qualitative comparative purposes. A series of classic bibliometric indexes were used. Results. The mean of references per paper is 10·64 ± 10·42; this increased over time (P < 0·001). Review papers have more references (P < 0·001). Price index (percentage of references published during the last 5 years) is 44% and the Insularity (percentage of references published in same country as the article) is 55%. References to journals predominate (58·6%), with a growing tendency for references to Spanish nursing journals, although they are still scarce (18·1% of the references to journals). Spanish is the language of most of the references (60·3%), the second language being English (36·1%). Conclusions. Bibliographic references in Spanish nursing research papers are scarce and not very specific: this happens both in regard to Nursing Research and to publications in other national and international science areas. However, there is an increasing tendency of references (including references to nursing journals) in the period analysed. The age of the references places Spanish nursing in an intermediate position between the 'hard' sciences and the humanities; and, according to the type of documentation used, we find it halfway between experimental and natural sciences, and technologies and social sciences. There has been a slight increase in references in English in recent years.},

Nicknamed CAMEOs, the profiles can be used for retrieval of documents by human searchers or computerized agents. They can also be used for mapping an author's subject matter (in terms of descriptors, identifiers, and natural language) and studying his or her publishing career. Finally, they can be used to map the intellectual and social networks evident in citations to and from authors and in co-authorships.},

abstract={The idea of a unified citation index to the literature of science was first outlined by Eugene Garfield in 1955 in the journal Science. Science Citation Index has since established itself as the gold standard for scientific information retrieval. It has also become the database of choice for citation analysts and evaluative bibliometricians worldwide. As scientific publication moves to the web, and novel approaches to scholarly communication and peer review establish themselves, new methods of citation and link analysis will emerge to capture often liminal expressions of peer esteem, influence and approbation. The web thus affords bibliometricians rich opportunities to apply and adapt their techniques to new contexts and content: the age of 'bibliometric spectroscopy' is dawning.},

abstract={The artificial neuronal networks (ANN) are applied in a wide range of the humankind activities. One of them is as a tool for the data analysis, specially within Bibliometrics. In this paper an introduction to some special features of the ANN is made, mainly those based on the Kohonen model (Self-organizing maps). The different elements that form these networks are presented and their working principle is linked to the Bibliometrics. A software called Viscovery SOMine® that takes, for its own running, the concepts and algorisms from the Self-organizing maps is used and characterized. Finally, the use of the ANN in the Bibliometrics is shown through different case of studies.},

abstract={A recent literature review highlighted the knowledge-based view as an important current theory in the strategic management area. The current paper utilizes that theory as the context for employing bibliometrics to uncover the publishing and patenting citation patterns in a group of twelve US pharmaceutical companies over a 13-year period. Our initial findings suggest that firms self-cite a great deal, and that they rely heavily on public science. In addition, we found that Merck and Co. is the most frequently cited company in both the science and technology areas, though somewhat less so in technology. The managerial implications, particularly from a knowledge perspective, are discussed as well as some suggestions for future research.},

abstract={This paper makes the assumption that Norwegian patenting in the US reflects a quasi-universe of Norwegian technological capabilities. Based on this assumption, the paper combines a "patent-bibliometrics" and a "technometrics" approach to study other relevant bodies of knowledge these capabilities build upon. In order to study interactions at the "science-technology-innovation interface", the paper maps the citation patterns that radiate from the patent population (1990-96) to other areas of technology (patent-citations) and to science-bases (citations to Non-Patent Literature or NPL). The study identifies important technology-technology links that involve machinery, process-engineering and chemical and significant science-technology links that involve pharmaceuticals and instruments.},

abstract={The Australian government has expressed a continuing interest in the assessment of research productivity as a basic element of a 'rationalised' research funding process. Bibliometric analyses are among the techniques that the government uses to evaluate the quality of research performance. Like many other disciplines, sociology is a target of these assessments. This paper presents data to demonstrate how Australian sociology might measure up if subjected to an inquiry using these methods. Data are provided on the standing of Australian sociology internationally and on the research contributions of major Australian universities. Several important methodological issues are reviewed and discussed. It is concluded that Australian sociologists would be well served by becoming active participants in the ongoing national debate over the assessment of research performance and the allocation of funding for tertiary education and science.},

abstract={Database tomography (DT) is a textual database analysis system consisting of two major components: (1) algorithms for extracting multiword phrase frequencies and phrase proximities (physical closeness of the multiword technical phrases) from any type of large textual database, to augment (2) interpretative capabilities of the expert human analyst. DT was used to derive technical intelligence from a fullerenes database derived from the Science Citation Index and the Engineering Compendex. Phrase frequency analysis by the technical domain experts provided the pervasive technical themes of the fullerenes database, and phrase proximity analysis provided the relationships among the pervasive technical themes. Bibliometric analysis of the fullerenes literature supplemented the DT results with author/journal/institution publication and citation data. Comparisons of fullerenes results with past analyses of similarly structured near-earth space, chemistry, hypersonic/supersonic flow, aircraft, and ship hydrodynamics databases are made. One important finding is that many of the normalized bibliometric distribution functions are extremely consistent across these diverse technical domains and could reasonably be expected to apply to broader chemical topics than fullerenes that span multiple structural classes. Finally, lessons learned about integrating the technical domain experts with the data mining tools are presented.},

It was found that the number of articles on AD were increasing years by years. The articles in China were related with 32 subjects. The 12 research focus on AD in recent 3 years were listed. Most of researches were carried out in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong and in the east of China. Conclusion: It suggested that research on AD has great prospect. The research focus on AD carded out in China were similar with western country in recent years. The main research subject related with AD were geratology, pharmacology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and biochemistry.},

abstract={The possibility is examined of diffusing and adapting bibliometric methods to technical literature for the measurement of technological output. The first part deals with existing methods in the treatment of such literature for the generation of technology indicators, which consists mainly in the extraction of new products information from technical and trade journals. Other indicators are examined, since the question must be approached from the standpoint of the global science and technology statistics system to determine the complementarity of each indicator. The second part describes the construction of a new-products database for the mechanical industry. Its originality stems from its integration in an awareness service offered to private firms by a technical center. Since technical information services are a fastgrowing industry, the possibility of exploiting such information to build technology indicators is at stake. The quality of information remains the main stumbling-block.},

abstract={This paper examines the process of the institutionalization of research in physics in India. In order to do so, it employs bibliometric data such as research publications in physics research journals between 1900 and 1950. This data is then analyzed to obtain certain indicators that are pointers of the aspects of the institutionalization of research in physics in India. The four aspects of institutionalization studied here are important for the researches of those adopting sociological approaches in the study of the history of sciences. Thus the bibliometric techniques employed complements the efforts of historians of science studying the professionalization of physics research in India, and in this case those dealing with disciplines like physics. Further, the bibliometric data helps substantiate the claims of historians of science that the years 1905 to 1935 were particularly important for the history of physics in India. The conclusions of historians are based on success stories of a few leading physicists of the time. Within an institutional framework, this paper argues that there was a larger ground swell indicative of the emergence of a physics research community in India.},

abstract={Although the coinage of the term Bibliometrics is fairly recent, its usage and practice can be traced back to the 1890's. Bibliometrics has been used vastly as a quantitative method for evaluating the literature in different disciplines, particularly in the last two decades. This article is intended to review bibliometrics and one of its major methods citation analysis in two different parts: the first part of this article aims to present a background of the bibliometrics and citation analysis. The applications of citation analysis are also studied in this part. In the second part of this article: document and author co-citation analysis as well as joumal-by-journal and country-by-counhy citation analysis are studied. Mapping science as an application of co-citation analysis is also studied, finally the limitations, problems and reliability and validity of citation analysis as a research method will be considered. ©Munksgaard 1996.},

abstract={Slow development of bibliometric theory may be due in part to neglect of the unit of analysis - the objects described by variables and about which inferences are made. Problems include: inferences are often made on units other than those sampled, leading to inappropriate conclusions; units in literature reviews and meta-analysis are often not comparable, thus hindering cumulation of knowledge; confusion when names of sampling units in one study might also be the names of variables in other studies - e.g., no. of citations (variable) to papers (sampling unit) and no. of papers (variable) in journals (sampling unit); loss of information about the unit of analysis, means and variances when data are aggregated. If theory is to advance, scientometrics needs a generic definition of the unit of analysis, a complete list of all known units - classified and structured, meta-analyses, reporting standards - especially when data are aggregated, clear indications of data level (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio), conventions for including units in titles, abstracts and keyword or subject indexes.},

abstract={In view of changes in scientific communication towards an electronic environment, this paper sketches the development of bibliometric tools for use in a scientific publishing environment. The main areas of application are: quality control of individual products; market analysis; strategic analysis for long-term planning; and product development Each of these requires different indicators and tools, which are critically discussed. The influence of the type of journal and scientific discipline on the usefulness and interpretation of the impact factor is addressed briefly, and requirements for indicators are discussed against the background of possible, future changes in the scientific communication process. This leads to speculation on the role of bibliometrics, and how to organise it, in an electronic communication environment. © 1995 Beech Tree Publishing.},

abstract={In our 1975 monograph "Evaluative Bibliometrics" we discussed the many uses of publication and citation analysis in the evaluation of scientific activities, and some of the basic statistical properties of the scientific literature, particularly the skewness of the distributions of publications and citations, reference time distributions, and various anomalies in the citation patterns from one country to another. Over the last ten years we have devoted much of our energy to the development of an analogous research base and infrastructure for patent bibliometrics, that is for the use of patents, and patent citations in the evaluation of technological activities. There are remarkable similarities between literature bibliometrics and patent bibliometrics, and they are both applicable to the same wide ranges of problems. This paper will show that there are striking similarities between literature and patent distributions of national productivity, inventor productivity, referencing cycles, citation impact and within country citation preferences. © 1994 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

abstract={This literature review covers multiple authorship as it relates to research on scholarly publishing within library and information science. The article examines the research on collaboration in other disciplines and considers the methodological impact of various ways of allotting "credit" for multi-authored works and the relationships between multiple authorship and other publication variables, such as quality and impact. Given the complex relationship between collaboration and productivity, the concomitant use of nonbibliometric methods of studying collaboration, as well as the application of meta-analysis, is suggested.},

abstract={This article presents the results of a study carried out for CNRS policy makers. The goal of the study was two-fold: first, it was aimed at evaluating the research effort devoted to "understanding chemical reactions" both in France and throughout the world; second, it was designed to test the usefulness of bibliometric techniques for strategic analysis. One feature of this article merits special attention. It is co-signed by the researchers who carried out the study and by the policy makers for whom it was intended. © 1991 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

abstract={The fit of Bradford's Law to bibliometrics - a field which is both interdisciplinary and relatively new was investigated. It is found that, contrary to expectations, the data fit Bradford's Law very well, particularly in the more recent period, 1979-1983. There are, in both periods studied, seven core journals with about 30% of the papers; most of these journals are specialized in information science or documentation. No "falling away" from Bradford's distribution towards the right-hand end of the bibliography was observed. © 1990 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

This article reviews studies which supply data to assess the validity and accuracy of citation indicators as a measure of performance. To illustrate the points raised, the article also examines results obtained by case studies on Nordic cancer and cardiovascular research. It concludes that citations measure recognition of a piece of work by the international scientific community, but are also influenced by publication structures, citation conventions and social relations in the scientific community. Citation analysis complements peer review by supplying evidence to assess its accuracy and reliability. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract={Data on article distributions over journal titles and subject subdivisions of a selected field could be extracted (on- or offline) from every bibliographic file including a classification scheme. On the basis of such data, journals could be subdivided into specialized, average, or general using an appropriate measure of dispersion (or concentration). To this end, Pratt's absolute measure of dispersion q = σr* Fr, is suggested, where the Fr, represent the relative frequencies (in descending order) of articles from a given journal in the unidentified subject subdivisions with rank r = 1, 2, ..., n. In order to separate specialized and general journals from average ones, it is assumed that each empirical q-value has a 'random' deviation d. A w-statistic is introduced to test whether the q-values differ significantly from the average qav on a specified confidence level, where w = (q - qav)/d. In addition, a subject relative measure of dispersion Q is used to determine which subdivisions are favored by which journals. Another w-statistic is proposed to test whether the Q-values differ significantly from Qs (absolute measure of dispersion of the subject distribution). This bibliometric technique is applied to data from the 1984 INSPEC file. The results could help library staff and information scientists in classifying journals according to the two measures of article dispersion over subject subdivisions. © 1990.},

abstract={The paper describes the curriculum subject matter and its placement in the didactic processes at the Institute of Library and Information Science (Instytut Bibliotekoznawstwa i Informacji Naukowej IBIN) at the Warsaw University comparing some elements with other academic schools in Poland. Bibliographic traditions, and traditions in teaching the history of science are indicated as the basis for the present state of affairs. In addition to the discussion of classes and topics dealing with bibliometrics and scientometrics, also problems of reading list repertoire and subject matter of research work, connected with the didactic activity considered, are discussed. In the conclusions it is stated that inadequate explicitness of the scope and object of bibliometrics bears on the dispersion and lack of self-subsistence of bibliometrics substance. © 1987 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

It was found that the growth pattern is befitting qualitatively with the epidemic growth model. Of the 1460 items, 828 are scattered in 288 journals. The pattern of scatter has been fitted in an empirical formula, a linear equation of the form R(r)=ar-b, where R(r) is the Mean Relative Scatter (MRS) of the articles over a class of ranked journals in increasing productivity and r is the rank of the class, a and b are the arbitary constants. The formula, if deductively established, can serve as an effective alternative to Bradford's law. © 1986 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

abstract={The dramatic improvement in database searching service by the reference librarians in academic libraries to both faculty and student is stressed from the viewpoint of the information manager. The use of computer-assisted bibliographic service is examined to help identify periodical subscriptions which might be cancelled. The results of this experiment are considered somewhat less than satisfactory inasmuch as no clear candidates for cancellation were identified. What is more, the cost of the experiment in connect-hours to the databases, offline print royalties, and the search analyst's time far exceeded the savings which might have accrued from eventual cancellation of subscriptions. These experiences are offered as a warning to others who might be thinking about an online bibliometric study in another academic library.},

The most rapid growth took place between 1970 and 1975. It appears that the annual growth rate has slowed since 1975. Most of the literature appeared as articles in 138 journals. 19 journals contained five or more papers each and contributed 392 papers (38% of the total). Papers on online information retrieval are dispersed in a wide variety of journals, many of them not devoted to library or information science. An unsuccessful attempt was made to apply Bradford's Law to the literature.

abstract={Bibliometrics, as a practical tool of library collection management, is not easily identifiable in the literature. As a term, it suffers from literature scatter: 52 different subject headings are necessary to access fully the library literature. Additionally, the twofold nature of bibliometrics is often obscured by contributors to the field who deal with a single dimension. Understanding of bibliometrics and its location in the library literature are essential to its exploitation as a method of library collection management. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The literatures of two antispastic drugs, baclofen and dantrolene sodium, were studied bibliometrically for their first decade and were found to be generally similar. Baclofen had 93 papers and dantrolene sodium had 70. About a quarter of the baclofen papers were in a foreign language, whereas almost all dantrolene sodium papers were in English. Baclofen literature had a lower nonscholarly content, but the scholarly increase, 5%, was the same for both. Both drugs had an average of 12 references per paper. The literatures of both drugs had a similar degree of Internal coheslveness; almost half of their papers referred to other papers in the same drug collection. The first human paper for baclofen was the second published; for dantrolene sodium, it was the eleventh. The distribution of journals carrying papers on each of these drugs followed Bradford's law. Two authors per paper was the average for each drug. The productivity of authors approximated Lotka's law for both drugs. About two-thirds of the papers of both drugs had a drug-word in their titles. The literature of both drugs contained about 15% legendary papers, typical of clinical pharmacology. The most intense papers, 15 for baclofen and 11 for dantrolene sodium, were identified, using citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation frequencies. A generalization predicts what might be expected from the literature of future antispastic drugs.},
