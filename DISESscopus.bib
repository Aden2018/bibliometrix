abstract={We introduce a parsimonious model-based framework for clustering time course data. In these applications the computational burden becomes often an issue due to the large number of available observations. The measured time series can also be very noisy and sparse and an appropriate model describing them can be hard to define. We propose to model the observed measurements by using P-spline smoothers and then to cluster the functional objects as summarized by the optimal spline coefficients. According to the characteristics of the observed measurements, our proposal can be combined with any suitable clustering method. In this paper we provide applications based on non-hierarchical clustering algorithms. We evaluate the accuracy and the efficiency of our proposal by simulations and by analyzing two real data examples. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This research paper focuses on coopetition among small and medium tourism enterprises (SMEs), and has two objectives. First it makes a theoretical contribution by establishing a model of variables that induce coopetition, the degrees to which coopetition exists and the relationship between those variables and firm performance. Second, it tests the modeling in the context of the tourism industry in Naples and Sorrento, Italy. The former comprises a sample of 149 accommodation providers and the latter 169. Building on survey data and local linkages between accommodation providers and SMEs in tourism it is found that coopetition improves performance but a key determinant is not only numbers of links but also acquired trust between partners. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present a long-range terrestrial laser scanner application for the geostructural mapping of Coroglio cliff, a tuff rock face exposed along the coastal zone of Campi Flegrei, Napoli. The procedure includes several phases (geomorphological analysis, structural field survey, laser scanner data acquisition and data processing, 3-D model development and analysis, geostructural classification of discontinuity orientation data and 2-D vertical cartographic production). Field data were processed with specific software dedicated to geostructural and geometric analysis. Spatial data were managed with a geographical information system and have been used for the construction of 2-D and 3-D geometric models of the rock cliff surface and geostructural interpretation. The main product of this study is a vertical geostructural map of the Coroglio cliff at 1:500 scale that illustrates the spatial distribution and orientation of the major families of structural discontinuities detected along the exposed surface of the cliff. The cartographic product includes base information useful to identify the main rock failure mechanisms along the cliff and represents a first step for the zonation of areas susceptible to block failures and the planning of monitoring activities. © 2015 Fabio Matano.},

abstract={MinSup problems with constraints described by quasi-equilibrium problems are considered in Banach spaces. The solutions set of such problems may be empty even in very good situations, so the aim of this paper is twofold. First, we determine appropriate regularizations (called inner regularizations) which allow to reach the value of the original problem. Then, among these regularizations we identify those which allow to bypass the lack of exact solutions to these problems by a suitable concept of “viscosity” solution whose existence is then proved under reasonable assumptions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The nervus terminalis (NT) is the most anterior of the vertebrate cranial nerves. In teleost fish, the NT runs across all olfactory components and shows high morphological variability within this taxon. We compare the anatomical distribution, average number and size of the FMRFamide-immunoreactive (ir) NT cells of fourteen teleost species with different positions of olfactory bulbs (OBs) with respect to the ventral telencephalic area. Based on the topology of the OBs, three different neuroanatomical organizations of the telencephalon can be defined, viz., fish having sessile (Type I), pseudosessile (short stalked; Type II) or stalked (Type III) OBs. Type III topology of OBs appears to be a feature associated with more basal species, whereas Types I and II occur in derived and in basal species. The displacement of the OBs is positively correlated with the peripheral distribution of the FMRFamide-ir NT cells. The number of cells is negatively correlated with the size of the cells. A dependence analysis related to the type of OB topology revealed a positive relationship with the number of cells and with the size of the cells, with Type I and II topologies of OBs showing significantly fewer cells and larger cells than Type III. A dendrogram based on similarities obtained by taking into account all variables under study, i.e., the number and size of the FMRFamide-ir NT cells and the topology of OBs, does not agree with the phylogenetic relationships amongst species, suggesting that divergent or convergent evolutionary phenomena produced the olfactory components studied. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We offer a new and robust model of the emergence and persistence of cooperation when interactions are anonymous, the population is well mixed, and evolution selects strategies according to material payoffs. The model has a Prisoner’s Dilemma structure, but with an outside option of non-participation. The payoff to mutual cooperation is stochastic; with positive probability, it exceeds that from cheating against a cooperator. Under mild conditions, mutually beneficial cooperation occurs in equilibrium. This is possible because the non-participation option holds down the equilibrium frequency of cheating. Dynamic properties of the model are investigated theoretically and through simulations based on replicator dynamics. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Preference rankings virtually appear in all fields of science (political sciences, behavioral sciences, machine learning, decision making and so on). The well-known social choice problem consists in trying to find a reasonable procedure to use the aggregate preferences or rankings expressed by subjects to reach a collective decision. This turns out to be equivalent to estimate the consensus (central) ranking from data and it is known to be a NP-hard problem. A useful solution has been proposed by Emond and Mason in 2002 through the Branch-and-Bound algorithm (BB) within the Kemeny and Snell axiomatic framework. As a matter of fact, BB is a time demanding procedure when the complexity of the problem becomes untractable, i.e. a large number of objects, with weak and partial rankings, in presence of a low degree of consensus. As an alternative, we propose an accurate heuristic algorithm called FAST that finds at least one of the consensus ranking solutions found by BB saving a lot of computational time. In addition, we show that the building block of FAST is an algorithm called QUICK that finds already one of the BB solutions so that it can be fruitfully considered to speed up even more the overall searching procedure if the number of objects is low. Simulation studies and applications on real data allows to show the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposal. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background and aims: Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by food restriction, irrational fear of gaining weight and consequent weight loss. High mortality rates have been reported, mostly due to suicide and malnutrition. Good outcomes largely vary between 18 and 42 %. We aimed to assess outcome and prognostic factors of a large group of patients with anorexia nervosa. Moreover we aimed to identify clusters of prognostic factors related to specific outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of 100 patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa previously hospitalized in a tertiary level structure. Then we performed follow-up structured telephone interviews. Results: We identified four dead patients, while 34 % were clinically recovered. In univariate analysis, short duration of inpatient treatment (p = 0.003), short duration of disorder (p = 0.001), early age at first inpatient treatment (p = 0.025) and preserved insight (p = 0.029) were significantly associated with clinical recovery at follow-up. In multiple logistic regression analysis, duration of first inpatient treatment, duration of disorder and preserved insight maintained their association with outcome. Moreover multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis allowed to identify different typologies of patients with specific features. Notably, group 1 was characterized by two or more inpatient treatments, BMI ≤ 14, absence of insight, history of long-term inpatient treatments, first inpatient treatment ≥30 days. While group 4 was characterized by preserved insight, BMI ≥ 16, first inpatient treatment ≤14 days, no more than one inpatient treatment, no psychotropic drugs intake, duration of illness ≤4 years. Conclusions: We confirmed the association between short duration of inpatient treatment, short duration of disorder, early age at first inpatient treatment, preserved insight and clinical recovery. We also differentiated patients with anorexia nervosa in well-defined outcome groups according to specific clusters of prognostic factors. Our study might help clinicians to evaluate prognosis of patients with anorexia nervosa. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

The quasi-Nash equilibrium has the property to be stable with respect to perturbations on both payoff functions and mistakes in playing pure strategy profiles. We compare our relaxed equilibrium with the Reny equilibrium (introduced in a recent paper) and give stability properties for the Reny equilibrium. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={At the moment of Italian political unification, the Mezzogiorno (i.e. Southern Italy) was affected by a deep institutional change and it entered the wave of financial market openness, attracting all forms of investments from international capital markets. Naples – after having lost its previous role as the Bourbon kingdom’s capital city – enabled projects of large scale urban planning, beginning with basic public utilities. In this process, public and private lighting was chronologically the first area of interest – parallel with railway development planning – where international finance played a role. As evidence of the dynamics which brought this peripheral European area into the orbit of the first globalisation, this article addresses the complex business of energy supply in Naples – between 1862 and World War I – both from the point of view of its financial dynamics and the parallel evolution and organisational characteristics of the business actors involved. The Social Network Analysis (SNA) will support the reconstruction of the diversified and transnational businesses which the Neapolitan energy business was integrated in, at the same time giving evidence of both the bindings linking legally independent companies and the multiple relations between the actors involved. The transition from gas to electricity during this time marked the transition from weak to strong corporate ties according to the evolutionary trends both of technology and international financial markets. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Europe's financial structure has become strongly bank-based-far more so than in other economies. We document that an increase in the size of the banking system relative to equity and private bond markets is associated with more systemic risk and lower economic growth, particularly during housing market crises. We argue that these two phenomena arise owing to an amplification mechanism, by which banks overextend and misallocate credit when asset prices rise, and ration it when they drop. The paper concludes by discussing policy solutions to Europe's 'bank bias', which include reducing regulatory favouritism towards banks, while simultaneously supporting the development of securities markets. © CEPR, CESifo, Sciences Po, 2016.},

abstract={The role of observational learning in dogs has drawn great interest from the scientific community. However, only a few studies explored its potential use for training purposes. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential benefit of conspecific observational learning in a dog training context. Fifty adult Labrador retrievers were recruited at the Italian Water Rescue School. Dogs were equally distributed between basic and advanced training level and assigned to demonstration and control groups.The experimental procedure consisted of two phases: Phase 1, intended to ascertain that dogs could not perform the selected exercise when requested by their handlers; Phase 2, to assess whether they would perform the same exercise after the observation of a conspecific demonstrator. The tests were performed outdoors in a fenced training area and one out of two dynamic exercises were selected for each dog: jumping on a trunk or hop on a slide for children. The outcome of Phase 2 was coded into a binary variable as successful or unsuccessful and a generalized linear model with binary logistic link function was used to analyze outcomes. The model included the dog's age as a covariate and the experimental group, level of experience, sex and all two-ways interactions as fixed factors. The dogs' probability to replicate the action increased significantly after demonstration by a conspecific compared to a control group and such probability improves with age. This study supports the usefulness of the intraspecific observational learning in adult dogs for training purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The psychological aspect in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is poorly documented. We sought to determine the role of DEB in anxiety, depression and self-esteem. We conducted a cross-sectional study, collecting data from 27 DEB patients and 26 healthy individuals. DEB patients and healthy controls completed three different psychometric scales for anxiety and depression and one scale for self-esteem. DEB patients and healthy controls were homogeneous for age and sex (P > 0.05), but not for employment, marital status and economic level (P < 0.05). Median values of all psychometric battery scales were not statistically significant between DEB patients and healthy controls, except for Goldberg scale for anxiety (P = 0.003) and depression (P = 0.037) and slightly significant for Zung Scale for anxiety (P = 0.048) with no difference between DEB patients with dominant versus recessive form in all scales (P > 0.05). Among DEB patients, only employment showed a significant difference in all scales (P < 0.05) but Hamilton for depression, whereas self-esteem seemed to be affected by marriage (P = 0.04) and education (P = 0.016). DEB patients apparently are not more anxious and/or depressed and do not have less self-esteem than healthy individuals. © 2015 Japanese Dermatological Association.},

abstract={Failures of banks' governance and risk management functions have been identified as key causes of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. This article reviews the empirical literature that investigates the relationship between governance structures and risk management functions as well as their impact on banks' risk taking and performance. I first discuss risk management's responsibilities and relevance for a value-maximizing bank. The business nature of financial institutions and their funding structure, together with explicit and implicit government guarantees, set them apart from nonfinancial firms. I argue that conventional governance structures alone may be unable to restrain risk taking in banks and thus the presence of a strong and independent risk management function becomes necessary to monitor and control enterprise-wide risk exposures. Recent evidence shows that a strong risk management function, compatible with the appropriate business model and culture, can restrain tail risk exposures at financial institutions and promote long-term value maximization. ©2015 by Annual Reviews.

abstract={This paper looks at the effects of International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending programs on banking crises in a large sample of developing countries, over the period 1970-2010. The endogeneity of the IMF intervention is addressed by adopting an instrumental variable strategy and a propensity score matching estimator. Controlling for the standard determinants of banking crises, the results indicate that countries participating in IMF-supported lending programs are significantly less likely to experience a future banking crisis than nonborrowing countries. The paper also provides evidence suggesting that compliance with conditionality and loan size matter, corroborating the importance of IMF-supported reform and liquidity provision for banking sector stability. © 2015 International Monetary Fund.},

abstract={Objective: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and their relationship with pain. Design: Cross-sectional clinical study. Setting: University-Hospital. Subjects: 75 BMS patients were enrolled. Methods: The study was conducted between September 2011 and March 2012 at the "Federico II" University of Naples. Demographic characteristics and clinical information including age, sex, educational level, marital status, job status, age at disease onset, oral symptoms, and triggers were collected via questionnaire interviews. To assess pain intensity the visual analogue scale (VAS) was administered. Descriptive statistics were collected, and Pearson Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests and the Spearman bivariate correlation were performed. Results: The mean age was 61.17 (±11.75, female/male ratio=3:1). The mean age at disease onset was 56.75 (±12.01). A low educational level (8.57±4.95) and 80% of unemployment were found. Job status and age at disease onset correlated with the VAS scale (P=0.019 and P=0.015, respectively). Tongue morphology changes, taste disturbances, and intraoral foreign body sensation have a significant dependence on gender (P=0.049, 0.001, and 0.045, respectively); intraoral foreign body sensation has a significant dependence on marital status (P=0.033); taste disturbances have a significant dependence on job status. (P=0.049); xerostomia has a significant dependence on age (P=0.039); and tongue color changes and a bitter taste have a significant dependence on educational level (P=0.040 and 0.022, respectively). Marital status and educational level have a significant dependence on the triggers (P=0.036 and 0.049, respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of BMS is higher in women, and in married, unemployed, and less highly educated patients. Burning is the most frequent symptom while stressful life events are the most frequent trigger reported. © 2015 American Academy of Pain Medicine.},

abstract={We study the opinions on prostitution that emerged from the World Value Survey. We show that individuals tends to justify prostitution more in countries where it is legal or regulated and less in countries where it is prohibited, even after controlling for religious, cultural and sociological factors. To overcome the endogeneity of the policy to the opinions, we propose an instrumental variable strategy, instrumenting prostitution policy with legal origins. At least for the case of prostitution, policies seem to affect opinions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The most common approach to build a decision tree is based on a twostep procedure: growing a full tree and then prune it back. The goal is to identify the tree with the lowest error rate. Alternative pruning criteria have been proposed in literature. Within the framework of recursive partitioning algorithms by tree-based methods, this paper provides a contribution on both the visual representation of the data partition in a geometrical space and the selection of the decision tree. In our visual approach the identification of the best tree and of the weakest links is immediately evaluable by the graphical analysis of the tree structure without considering the pruning sequence. The results in terms of error rate are really similar to the ones returned by the classification and regression trees (CART) procedure, showing how this new way to select the best tree is a valid alternative to the wellknown cost-complexity pruning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

abstract={The main aim of the paper is to examine the drivers of university-firm R&D collaboration while at the same time assessing the determinants of innovation in a low-tech industry. This includes analysing firm R&D collaborations with partners different from universities. The paper relies on a unique data-set where firm data were sourced from the Capitalia survey, covering the 1995-2006 years, and the university data were gathered from a number of sources. Result from a multivariate probit model reiterate that university-firm R&D collaboration affects process innovation. Evidence of a more novel kind suggests that product innovation is positively affected by geographical proximity to a university but is negatively affected by the amount of its codified knowledge production. Degree programmes in fields useful for local firms favour R&D collaborations. Academic policies that aim to commercialise research output negatively impact both product and process innovations of local firms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the presence of transactions costs, no matter how small, arbitrage activity does not necessarily render equal all riskless rates of return. When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite expenditure of transactions costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets will be allowed to differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The combination of randomness in expected rates of return and proportional transactions costs is a serious blow to existing frictionless pricing models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present study aimed at evaluating possible behavioural differences between guide dogs living in a kennel and interacting with a trainer and those living in a house and interacting with a blind person and their family, when they are faced with an unsolvable task. Fifty-two Labrador retrievers were tested: 13 Trained Guide dogs at the end of their training programme and 11 Working Guide dogs that had been living with their blind owner for at least 1 year. Two control groups of Labrador retrievers were also tested: 14 Young Untrained dogs of the same age as the Trained Guide and 14 Old Untrained dogs of the same age as the Working Guide dogs. Results showed that the Trained Guide dogs gazed towards the owner or the stranger for less time and with a higher latency and spent more time interacting with the experimental apparatus than the other three groups, which all behaved similarly. None of the groups tested showed preferences in gazing towards the stranger or the owner. Together, the results suggest that at the end of their training programme, guide dogs are less prone to engage in human-directed gazing behaviour and more likely to act independently when facing an unsolvable task. Conversely, guide dogs that have been living with a blind person (and their family) for 1 year behave like pet dogs. These findings indicate that guide dogs’ gazing towards humans is favoured by living in close proximity with people and by interacting with them. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We assess the effect of migrants' stock on the production structure of the Italian provinces (NUTS3) in 1995-2006. Although the investigated time span is very short, the effect is small but statistically significant: a doubling in the ratio of foreign-born residents to the province population induces a significant increase in manufactures' value added with respect to services' value added between 12 and 21 per cent. These effects are more intense when considering an increase in foreign-born populations drawn from countries more different to Italy (in terms of GDP per capita and educational attainment).These results are compatible with the reduced form of a two-sector model where we assume that production is performed with one mobile factor and two sector-specific CES labor composites of simple and complex tasks. If migrants and natives have different productivity when performing simple or complex tasks, an inflow of migrants induces production restructuring in favor of the simple-task intensive sector. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper tests for the effect of an increase in the migration rate on manufacturing firms' performance at the local level. The model is estimated for the Italian economy during the recent years of rapid and varied migration. We construct measures for both a representative province-sector firm and a representative province firm and estimate the impact of migrants on high- and low-tech sectors by also considering migrants heterogeneity (in terms of the characteristics of origin nationalities) in order to approximate the effect of high- and low-skill migrants. Migrants' presence positively affects firm's performance: a doubling of the migration ratio to provincial population raises sales per worker by 8-9 % on average. However, this increase is unevenly distributed and favors low-tech versus high-tech sectors. On the labor supply side, low-skill (primary-educated) migrants have a higher effect on firms' performance than high-skill (tertiary-educated) migrants. © 2014 Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.},

abstract={Background Gingival lesions in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) are a common manifestation. However, their clinical features, frequency and severity are currently unknown. Methods Forty-five DEB patients were assessed by an oral medicine specialist, who analysed the presence/absence of four clinical signs (erythema, erosion/ulcer, atrophy, blister) on free and attached gingiva, using the Epidermolysis Bullosa Oropharyngeal Severity score. Results Twenty-eight (62.2%) out of 45 DEB patients showed different types of gingival lesions, whose presence/absence and total frequency/distribution were not significantly different between males and females (p = 0.087 and p = 0.091, respectively). Erythema was the most prevalent lesion (66.2%) and the recessive DEB severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen) reached the highest median disease activity score. A significant correlation was observed between the DEB subtypes and the disease activity median score (p < 0.001), but not between age and total disease activity score in each group of DEB (p > 0.05). Lastly, logistic regression showed that only gender (p = 0.031) and RDEB-sev gen (p = 0.001) were risks factors for the presence of gingival lesions.

abstract={Product quality is often unobservable ex-ante and consumers rely on experts’ judgments, sometimes in the form of ratings or awards. Do awards affect consumers’ choices or, conversely, are they conferred on the most popular products? To disentangle this issue, we use data about the most important Italian literary prize, the “Strega Prize,” undertaking two different estimation strategies to evaluate the impact that winning the Prize has on book sales. First, we adopt a regression discontinuity design using a measure of book sales as a dependent variable and as a forcing variable (proxying for intrinsic book quality) the jury votes received by each nominated book in the competition. We find that the Strega Prize has a very strong impact on sales. Second, by using weekly data on appearances on bestseller lists, we estimate a difference-in-differences model in which we compare sales performance of treated and control books before the award is conferred with their respective performances afterward. The results confirm a huge influence of the Prize on book sales and show that most of the impact occurs in the weeks following the announcement of the Prize. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The great interest into hierarchical optimization problems and the increasing use of game theory in many economic or engineering applications led to investigate scalar bilevel problems in which the upper level is an optimization problem and the lower level is a parametrized quasi-variational inequality. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the sequences of infima and minima for the upper level when the data of the problem are perturbed. First, we show that general results on the convergence of the infima and minima may not be possible. Thus, we introduce suitable concepts of regularized semi-quasivariational optimistic bilevel problems and we study, in Banach spaces, the convergence properties of the infima and minima to these regularized problems in the presence or not of perturbations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A relevant question for the organization of large-scale research assessments is whether bibliometric evaluation and informed peer review yield similar results. In this paper, we draw on the experience of the panel that evaluated Italian research in Economics, Management and Statistics during the national assessment exercise (VQR) relative to the period 2004-2010. We exploit the unique opportunity of studying a sample of 590 journal articles randomly drawn from a population of 5681 journal articles (out of nearly 12,000 journal and non-journal publications), which the panel evaluated both by bibliometric analysis and by informed peer review. In the total sample we find fair to good agreement between informed peer review and bibliometric analysis and absence of statistical bias between the two. We then discuss the nature, implications, and limitations of this correlation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In a setting with a wishful thinking agent and a realistic principal, the paper studies how incentive contracts should be designed to control for both moral hazard and self-deception. The properties of the contract that reconcile the agent with reality depend on the weight the agent attaches to anticipatory utility. When this is small, principal and agent agree on full recollection. For intermediate values the principal bears an extra cost to make the agent recall bad news.

abstract={Conclusions: The present study shows that AGE, DELAY, and PTA-PRE may be considered factors influencing therapeutic success in intra-tympanic steroid therapy. Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between the therapeutic success of intra-tympanic prednisolone therapy and age, in patients affected by idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), considering the influence of factors such as delay, gender, and pure tone average (PTA) pre-therapy. Method: This retrospective study involved 402 consecutive patients, affected by unilateral ISSNHL between January 2009 and January 2014. Patients were divided into two groups based on age: group one with 94 patients aged over 65 years and group two with all 402 patients enrolled in the study, including those over 65. Results: PTA recorded before the beginning of the therapy (PTA-PRE) in group one was worse than for group two. In both groups the therapy was significantly effective in improving hearing thresholds, even if PTA-PRE was significant and negatively correlated with success rate. This effect disappeared within the population over 65. On average, each day of DELAY from the onset of hearing loss to the beginning of therapy cuts almost 2% of the possibility to recover. AGE was negative and significant when specified continuously for group two. © 2015 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of the application of green standards on the companies’ financial returns. It aims at answering the following question: does the market reward or penalize the players that carry out responsible management policies toward environment? Design/methodology/approach – Using US data from 2009 to mid-2014 and employing two financial models, that is Capital Asset Pricing Model and Fama-French three-factor model, the authors first estimate the extra remuneration provided to investors. Then, the authors link this extra return to a green-based factor. The green-factor data are taken from Newsweek Green Rankings, which annually publishes an environmental ranking of the 500 biggest publicly traded companies in the USA. Findings – The analysis demonstrates that there exists no linear relationship between the adoption of green standards and financial returns, i.e. the “green-behavior” does not affect the remuneration required by investors. These results could be justified by the fact that the implementation of environmentally friendly standards is quite a new one. Research limitations/implications – The results could be subject to major changes in next few years, due to the increasing attention over environmental issues. Originality/value – The paper investigates the financial profitability and the creation of economic value of a topical managerial issue, in light of the increasing importance of social responsible behavior for the companies. To the authors knowledge, this is the first paper that examines this topic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This chapter analyzes the impact of agglomeration on product and process innovation in Italy. Our main goal is to gain a better understanding of the spatial dimension of innovative activities. Based on a unique firm-level source of data provided by ISFOL containing information on employers’ personal profiles, we attempt to shed more light into the black box of the local knowledge spillovers. To this end, besides standard density measures, we define and employ an original density indicator and perform a series of IV regressions. Different from the main strands of the literature on this topic, which envisages positive knowledge spillover effects stemming from agglomeration, we do not find significant evidence that agglomeration fosters innovation. In particular, when small businesses are considered, a negative and significant effect arises. Such evidence suggests that in denser areas detrimental congestion effects tend to prevail and discourage innovation. Moreover, for this subsample of firms, the employers’ personal profile prove to be a relevant boost for innovation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015},

abstract={We present an intertemporal portfolio choice model where individuals invest in financial literacy, save, allocate their wealth between a safe and a risky asset, and receive a pension when they retire. Financial literacy affects the excess return from and cost of stock-market participation. Investors simultaneously choose how much to save, their portfolio allocation, and the optimal investment in financial literacy. The model implies that one should observe a positive correlation between stock-market participation (and risky asset share, conditional on participation) and financial literacy, and a negative correlation between the generosity of the social security system and financial literacy. The model also implies that financial literacy accumulated early in life is positively correlated with the individual's wealth and portfolio allocations in later life. Using microeconomic cross-country data, we find support for these predictions. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Accounting rules, through their interactions with capital regulations, affect financial institutions' trading behavior. The insurance industry provides a laboratory to explore these interactions: life insurers have greater flexibility than property and casualty insurers to hold speculative-grade assets at historical cost, and the degree to which life insurers recognize market values differs across U.S. states. During the financial crisis, insurers facing a lesser degree of market value recognition are less likely to sell downgraded asset-backed securities. To improve their capital positions, these insurers disproportionately resort to gains trading, selectively selling otherwise unrelated bonds with high unrealized gains, transmitting shocks across markets. © 2015 the American Finance Association.},

abstract={Multiple bank lending induces borrowers to take too much debt when creditor rights are poorly protected; moreover, banks wish to engage in opportunistic lending at their competitors' expenses if borrowers' collateral is sufficiently risky. These incentives lead to credit rationing and positive-profit interest rates, possibly exceeding the monopoly level. If banks share information about past debts and seniority via credit reporting systems, the incentive to overborrow is mitigated: interest and default rates decrease; credit access improves if the value of collateral is not very volatile, but worsens otherwise. Recent empirical studies report evidence consistent with these predictions. The article also shows that private and social incentives to share information are not necessarily aligned. © 2014 © The Authors 2014.

abstract={We extend Vind's classical theorem on the measure of blocking coalitions valid in finite dimensional atomless economies (see Vind (1972)), to include the possibility of infinitely many commodities as well as the presence of atoms. The commodity space is assumed to be an ordered Banach space which has possibly the empty positive cone. The lack of interior points is compensated by an additional assumption of a cone of arbitrage that allows us to use Lyapunov's convexity theorem in its weak form. The measure space of agents involves both negligible and non negligible traders. The extension is proved in the general class of Aubin coalitions for which a suitable version of Grodal's result (Grodal (1972)) is also formulated. Our results wish to point out the relevance of cone conditions dealing with blocking coalitions of arbitrary measure or weight. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective Erythema multiforme (EM) continues to be an underestimated disease with a lack of strict classification and diagnostic criteria. We present the analysis of a case series of 60 oral EM patients from 2 centers and illustrate the range of oral clinical presentations. Study Design Clinical data from 60 EM patients with oral involvement, diagnosed and treated between 1982 and 2014, were retrospectively collected from the archives of 2 independent hospitals. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the Pearson χ-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Result Thirty-one patients (51.7%) were male and 29 (48.3%) were female, with a mean (±SD) age of 37.9 years (±18.1). The frequency of previous occurrences ranged from 0 to 10 (mean ± SD: 1.4 ± 2.0). Twenty-nine patients (48%) had no previous occurrence. Medications (particularly antipyretics, food additives, and antibiotics) were the suspected precipitants in 28 patients (46.7%), whereas herpes simplex virus infection was suspected in 18 (30.0%). All but 1 patient had involvement of multiple oral sites, with the buccal mucosa being the most commonly involved oral site (75%), followed by the vermillion border (71.7%). Conclusions Patients with EM may present initially to oral health care workers. Medications and herpes simplex virus continue to be the most typically involved precipitating factors. Our data highlight the additional role of food-derived antigens. Although laboratory tests can provide support diagnostically, EM diagnosis continues to be based on clinical features. A medication and food diary should be encouraged particularly in patients with recurrent forms. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We build an equilibrium model of prostitution where clients and sex workers choose to demand and supply sex under three legal regimes: prohibition, regulation and laissez-faire. The key feature is the endogenous evolution of the risk as a consequence of policy changes. We calibrate the model to empirical evidence from Italy and then compare the effect of different policies on the equilibrium quantity of prostitution and on the harm associated with it. A prohibition regime that makes it illegal to buy sex but not to sell it is more effective than the opposite regime in reducing quantity. Taxes are one inducement to go illegal and prevent some of the less risky individuals from joining the market, leaving it smaller but riskier. A licensing system that prevents some infected individuals from joining the legal market reduces the risk and is therefore associated with an increase in quantity. Prohibition is preferable to minimize quantity only if a high expected fine is feasible. Regulation is best to minimize harm. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: The psychological factors and their association with chronic inflammatory disease, aren't well recognized, yet their importance in oral lichen planus is still debated. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression and their association in patient with oral lichen planus. Materials and methods 50 patients with oral lichen planus vs. equal number of age and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Questionnaires examining insomnia symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness (Pittsburgh sleep quality index and Epworth aleepiness scale) depression and anxiety (The Hamilton rating scale for Depression and Anxiety) were used. Results: The patients with oral lichen planus had statistically higher scores in all items of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Hamilton rating scale for depression and anxiety and Epworth sleepiness scale than the healthy controls. The median and inter-quartile range of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index was 5-2 and for the oral lichen planus patients and 4-2 for the healthy controls (P < 0.011). In the study group, a depressed mood and anxiety correlated positively with sleep disturbances. The Pearson correlations were 0.76 for Pittsburgh sleep quality Index vs. Hamilton rating scale for depression (P < 0.001) and 0.77 for Pittsburgh sleep quality Index vs. Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (P < 0.001). Discussion Oral lichen planus patients report a greater degree of sleep problems, depressed mood and anxiety as compared with controls. Conclusion: We suggest to screen sleep disturbances in patients with oral lichen planus because they could be considered a prodromal symptoms of mood disorders. © 2014 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.},

abstract={An exchange economy with asymmetrically informed agents is considered with an exogenous rule that regulates the information sharing among agents. In this context, the notion of stable sets à la von Neumann and Morgenstern is analyzed. Two different frameworks are taken into account as regards preferences: a model without expectations and a model with expected utilities. For the former, it is shown that the set V of all individually rational, Pareto optimal, symmetric allocations is the unique stable set of symmetric allocations. For the latter, an example is presented which shows that the same set V is not externally stable and a weaker result is proved. © IAET.},

abstract={In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the classic Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) on all firms listed in the Italian stock exchange at the monthly frequency. We intend to show that the CAPM, despite the heavy critical comments, still holds in the Italian market when returns are measured at the monthly frequency. Most importantly, our evidence indicates that the market portfolio fully explains the cross section of stock returns and there is no need to appeal for additional determinants. Our results have very important implications for long term investors who can forecast the expected excess stock returns by simply determining the β of the stock and the expected excess market return. © 2015, Virtus Interpress.

abstract={Due to technological advances there is the possibility to collect datasets of growing size and dimension. On the other hand, standard techniques do not allow the easy management of large dimensional data and new techniques need to be considered in order to find useful results. Another relevant problem is the information loss due to the aggregation in large data sets. We need to take into account this information richness present in the data which could be hidden in the data visualization process. Our proposal - which contributes to the literature on temporal data mining - is to use some new types of time series defined as the beanplot time series in order to avoid the aggregation and to cluster original high dimensional time series effectively. In particular we consider the case of high dimensional time series and a clustering approach based on the statistical features of the beanplot time series. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Objectives: Several empirical studies point out the relevance of individuals' physical attributes-such as height, weight, beauty-in the labor market. In the same way, physical characteristics may affect lifetime prospects through their impact on the selection of a partner in the marriage market. We analyzed to what extent an individual's height and weight (arguably affecting physical attractiveness, as documented in many studies) are related to lifetime economic outcomes through the marriage market, investigating whether individual height and weight affect the probability of marrying with a "high-quality partner," measuring quality as the partner's educational attainment or as the partner's prospective labor income. Methods: Using a large Italian dataset of married (and cohabiting) couples-the 2005 Italian Health Conditions Survey which provides information on health conditions, individual characteristics, and socioeconomic variables-we estimated separate OLS and Ordered Probit regressions for females and males. Since weight might be endogenously determined, to avoid any estimation bias we also estimated a reduced form equation in which predetermined height affects directly and indirectly (through BMI) physical attractiveness and, as a consequence, the choice of a partner with a given educational attainment. Results: Our findings suggest that height is a desirable trait in mating selection affecting the partner's socioeconomic characteristics: we found that taller individuals tended to mate with more educated partners, controlling for their own educational level-to take into account the tendency for assortative mating for education-and for other personal traits such as age, geographical residence, city size, and the presence of health problems. On the other hand, we showed that individuals with higher BMI were married to partners with lower levels of education. The results also provide evidence of non-linearity in the relationship between height and educational attainment of the partner. These findings are confirmed for both males and females, but being taller seems to be more relevant for males, while being thinner is more important for females. We have also found that taller and thinner females and males tend to be married with partners earning higher labor incomes. These findings were robust to a number of checks. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that the physical characteristics that an individual brings to the marriage market influences the outcome in this market: physical attractiveness is exchanged in the marriage market for a higher educational attainment and the ability to earn a higher labor income.

abstract={The analysis of ranking data has recently received increasing attention in many fields (i.e. political sciences, computer sciences, social sciences, medical sciences, etc.). Typically when dealing with preference rankings one of the main issue is to find a ranking that best represents the set of input rankings. Among several measures of agreement proposed in the literature, the Kendall distance is probably the most known. We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to find the solution(s) even when we take into account a relatively large number of objects to be ranked. We also propose a heuristic variant of the branch-and-bound algorithm useful when the number of objects to rank is particularly high. We show how the solution(s) achieved by the algorithm can be employed in diffierent analysis of rank data such as Mallow's ϕ model, mixtures of distance-based models, cluster analysis and so on. © Università del Salento.},

abstract={We study the interaction of a firm that invests in research and, if successful, undertakes a business practice to exploit the innovation, and an enforcer that sets legal standards, fines and accuracy. In this setting deterrence on actions interacts with deterrence on research. When the practice increases expected welfare the enforcer commits not to intervene by choosing a more rigid per-se legality rule to boost investment, moving to a more flexible discriminating rule combined with type-I accuracy for higher probabilities of social harm. Patent and antitrust policies act as substitutes in our setting; additional room for per-se (illegality) rules emerges when fines are bounded. Our results on optimal legal standards extend from the case of (uncertain) investment in research to the case of (deterministic) investment in physical assets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of the gaseous neurotransmitter nitric oxide. We compare the distribution of NADPH-d in the brain of four species of hylid frogs. NADPH-d-positive fibers are present throughout much of the brain, whereas stained cell groups are distributed in well-defined regions. Whereas most brain areas consistently show positive neurons in all species, in some areas species-specific differences occur. We analyzed our data and those available for other amphibian species to build a matrix on NADPH-d brain distribution for a multivariate analysis. Brain dissimilarities were quantified by using the Jaccard index in a hierarchical clustering procedure. The whole brain dendrogram was compared with that of its main subdivisions by applying the Fowlkes-Mallows index for dendrogram similarity, followed by bootstrap replications and a permutation test. Despite the differences in the distribution map of the NADPH-d system among species, cluster analysis of data from the whole brain and hindbrain faithfully reflected the evolutionary history (framework) of amphibians. Dendrograms from the secondary prosencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and isthmus showed some deviation from the main scheme. Thus, the present analysis supports the major evolutionary stability of the hindbrain. We provide evidence that the NADPH-d system in main brain subdivisions should be cautiously approached for comparative purposes because specific adaptations of a single species could occur and may affect the NADPH-d distribution pattern in a brain subdivision. The minor differences in staining pattern of particular subdivisions apparently do not affect the general patterns of staining across species. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={We develop an agency model of organized crime accounting for the main trade-offs involved in the introduction of an accomplice-witness program. We characterize the optimal policy and identify its main determinants in a framework where public officials can be dishonest. Our predictions are tested by using data for Italy before and after the introduction of the 1991 accomplice-witness program. As predicted by the model and the earlier antitrust literature, the program appears to have strengthened deterrence and enhanced prosecution. Moreover, consistent with a novel prediction of our theory, the evidence suggests that the program efficacy is affected by the judicial system efficiency. © The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2014.},

abstract={Previous investigations have attempted to correlate the genotype with the cutaneous phenotype in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), but never with the oropharyngeal phenotype. Seventeen dystrophic EB (DEB) patients were genotyped for COL7A1 gene mutations and divided into five distinct groups. Oropharyngeal disease severity was assessed with the Epidermolysis Bullosa Oropharyngeal Severity (EBOS) score by an oral medicine specialist. The genotype-phenotype correlation was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance using the Mann-Whitney test, applying the Bonferroni correction. The most severe oropharyngeal phenotype was found in the group with the 2470insG/3948insT mutation, with a mean disease severity score of 18.50 ± 2.12; the mildest was found in the 6862del16 mutation group, with a mean disease severity score of 0.57 ± 1.13. The most significant difference in median score was found in the total score (P = 0.009), followed by tongue (P = 0.02) and upper lip (P = 0.021), but no correlation was found between disease severity and the groups (P > 0.005, after Bonferroni correction). Multiple comparisons among the five different genotypic groups revealed no statistically significant genotype-oropharyngeal phenotype correlation; it was not possible to establish which group was more severe, or to associate a specific mutation to a specific oropharyngeal phenotype. © 2013 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

abstract={In this note we study a model of vertical hierarchies where the allocation of residual claimancy is endogenous and is determined jointly with production and contractual decisions. We show that the (equilibrium) allocation of residual claimancy may be affected by production externalities across hierarchies in a non-trivial manner. Specifically, although revenue-sharing contracts foster agents' (non-contractible) surplus enhancing effort, we show that principals dealing with exclusive and privately informed agents might still prefer to retain a share of the surplus from production when dealing with inefficient (high-cost) types. This is because reducing the surplus share of those types reduces the information rent given up to efficient (low-cost) types by means of a 'generalized competing contracts' effect. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In contrast, we find that financially healthier firms were affected more in functionally distant credit markets than in markets populated by less distant banks, consistent with a home bias on the part of nationwide banks. © 2014 The Ohio State University.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of quantifying longevity risk in a quantile perspective. In this field, the idea of deepening the expected changes of future mortality rates over a single year is gaining. In the following the authors propose an approach which combines a stochastic model for the evolution of mortality rates and a quantile analysis of the mortality distribution in order to capture the trend component of longevity. An ex post analysis is proposed, relying on the past mortality experience of the Italian male population measured in the period of 1954-2008. Numerical applications illustrate the results and their impact both on the survival probabilities and on the risk margin for the insurance company. © Albina Orlando, Giovanna Di Lorenzo, Massimiliano Politano, 2014.},

abstract={A proof of the existence of private core allocations is provided for an exchange economy ε where consumers and commodities are both infinite in number, supposing however that only finitely many types can be distinguished among traders. It is obtained passing through the Edgeworth equilibrium notion considered for a suitably associated discrete setting. For this setting a preliminary result-which is interesting in itself-is proved: in every discrete economy E with asymmetric information and unequal numbers of traders with the same characteristics there is a private core allocation which treats agents of the same type equally. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The paper focuses on a stochastic proportional hazard model depicting the evolution of the force of mortality; in particular the real data are plotted against a specific survival model by means of the stochastic process that describes their ratio. The predictive accuracy of the survival model is investigated, since, by means of the calibrated ratio process, its forecasting skills are assessed. A statistical analysis is developed in order to test the capacity the assumed survival model has to follow the real behavior of the observed data. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

abstract={Objective. To evaluate the internal consistency of the epidermolysis bullosa oropharyngeal severity score (EBOS). Materials and methods. Data from 92 patients of varying EB types/sub-types already described in a previous multi-center study were re-analyzed via the coefficient Cronbach's α (CR-α). Additionally, the corrected item total correlation between each item and the items' overall score with Pearson's product-moment correlation (ρ) was calculated. Results. The alpha coefficient for the mean total score of 17 items is 0.941. The inter-observer reliability for disease severity score was excellent for oral medicine specialist (α = 0.924) and dermatologist (α = 0.916) and the intra-observer reliability was good at Time 1 (α = 0.895) and Time 2 (α = 0.897). The analysis of CR-α per single item revealed that alpha was greater than 0.904 for disease activity and 0.743 for structural damage, after the elimination of four items for oral medicine specialist and greater than 0.898 for disease activity and 0.769 for structural damage after the elimination of five items for dermatologist. Similarly the analysis of the corrected items-EBOS correlation showed that the same items do not correlate very well (ρ < 0.4) with the overall EBOS. Conclusions. The EBOS turned out to have a strong and reliable internal consistency, as the majority of the EBOS' items were consistent with each other. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

The findings enlighten the existence of three main research streams, as well as the absence of a research evolution. The novelty of the paper relies on its contributions for academics by providing a keywords map as a useful tool to understand greatest concentration areas and vice versa never investigated issues whereon focusing future efforts.

abstract={We use responses to survey questions in the 2010 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth that ask consumers how much of an unexpected transitory income change they would consume. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 48 percent on average. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the distribution, as households with low cash-on-hand exhibit a much higher MPC than affluent households, which is in agreement with models with precautionary savings, where income risk plays an important role. The results have important implications for predicting household responses to tax reforms and redistributive policies.},

abstract={In this paper we review household saving and debt trends in Italy. We summarize the available empirical evidence on Italians' motives to save, relying on macroeconomic indicators and data drawn from the Bank of Italy's Surveys of Household Income and Wealth from 1984 to 2012. The macroeconomic data indicate that households' saving has dropped significantly, although Italy continues to rank above most other countries for saving. Using microeconomic data we examine four indicators of household financial conditions: propensity to save, proportion of households with negative saving, proportion of households with debt, and proportion of households that lack access to formal credit markets. An international comparison shows that the level of debt and default risk among Italian households are relatively low. However, in light of the deep changes made to the Italian pension system, the fall in saving is a concern, particularly in the case of individuals who entered the labor market after the 1995 reform and have experienced the largest decline in pension wealth. © 2015 SOCIETÁ EDITRICE IL MULINO.},

abstract={We consider a set of asymmetrically informed agents, where the information of each trader is susceptible of being altered when she becomes a member of a coalition. For this, we consider a general rule that depending on the coalition, a signal (or an information partition) is assigned to each member of the coalition. We set examples showing that Grodal's (Econometrica 40:581-583, 1972), Schmeidler's (Econometrica 40:579-580, 1972) and Vind's (Econometrica 40:585-586, 1972) core characterizations of a continuum economy may fail in this general informational setting. However, under mild assumptions on the rule, we extend Schmeidler's and Vind's results to economies that allocate information to agents in each coalition according to the rule. We then focus on information mechanisms based on the size of coalitions and provide a general characterization result for the corresponding cores. Moreover, we pay close attention to the rule that assigns the shared information to each member of specific coalitions. We prove that the resulting cores are exactly the same independently of whether arbitrarily small or large coalitions share information. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We provide a cross-country and cross-bank analysis of the financial determinants of the Great Financial Crisis using data on 83 countries from the period 1998 to 2006. First, our cross-country results show that the probability of suffering the crisis in 2008 was larger for countries having higher levels of credit deposit ratio whereas it was lower for countries characterized by higher levels of: (i) net interest margin, (ii) concentration in the banking sector, (iii) restrictions to bank activities, (iv) private monitoring. The bank-level analysis reinforces these results and shows that the latter factors are also key determinants across banks, thus explaining the probability of bank crisis. Our findings contribute to extend the analytical toolkit available for macro and micro-prudential regulation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A law issued to combat political corruption and Mafia infiltration of city councils in Italy has resulted in episodes of large, unanticipated, temporary contractions in local public spending. Using these episodes as instruments, we estimate the output multiplier of spending cuts at provincial level-controlling for national monetary and fiscal policy, and holding the tax burden of local residents constant-to be 1.5. Assuming that lagged spending is exogenous to current outputbrings the estimate of the overall multiplier up to 1.9. These results suggest that local spending adjustment may be quite consequential for local activity.},

abstract={One of the most contentious issues raised during the recent crisis has been the potentially exacerbating role played by mark-to-market accounting. Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire sales during a crisis, forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times which leads to a safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the US insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as 'early warning signals', (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life and P&C companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across US states. Our results indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2014.},

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of quantifying the longevity impact for defined contribution pension funds in a stochastic environment. In the accumulation phase it is well known that, in presence of a benefit guarantee, the investment risk dominates the demographic one. However, if the generic subscriber life expectancy increases, it is very likely that, in the decumulation phase, the wealth accrued will not be able to cover the liabilities of the fund. For this reason, the fund will be forced to set aside more resources in order to front its liabilities exposing itself to greater financial risk. In this paper we study the interaction between financial risk and longevity: based on the Italian experience for both financial and demographic factors, this work aims to measure the impact of longevity on the financial factor. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

We do it in general economies which include, as particular cases, the main models of differential information economies, providing in this framework a natural competitive equilibrium notion which satisfies the fair criterion. The analysis is conducted allowing the presence of large traders, which may cause the lack of perfect competition. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this paper, we look at the classical problem of aggregating individual utilities and study social orderings which are based on the concept of Ordered Weighted Averaging Aggregation Operator. In these social orderings, called Ordered Weighted Averaging Social Welfare Functions, weights are assigned a priori to the positions in the social ranking and, for every possible alternative, the total welfare is calculated as a weighted sum in which the weight corresponding to the kth position multiplies the utility in the kth position. In the α-Ordered Weighted Averaging Social Welfare Function, the utility in the kth position is the kth smallest value assumed by the utility functions, whereas in the β-Ordered Weighted Averaging Social Welfare Function it is the utility of the kth poorest individual. We emphasize the differences between the two concepts, analyze the continuity issue, and provide results on the existence of maximum points. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We develop a model of cultural transmission where television plays a role in socialisation. We study the coverage of different cultural traits by a profit-maximising TV industry and the resulting cultural dynamics. A monopolist covers both traits, but grants more coverage to the most profitable group. In a competitive TV industry each channel specialises on one trait. This might lead to cultural extinction, but only for sufficiently large majorities. Cultural extinction is more likely in a competitive than in a monopolistic TV industry. Overall our model predicts that cultural extinction can only occur under very special circumstances. © 2013 Royal Economic Society.},

abstract={This paper studies how incentives are affected by intention-based reciprocity preferences when the principal hires many agents. Our results describe the set of agents' sensitivities to reciprocity required to sustain a given strategy profile. We also show that hiring reciprocal agents to implement a first- or a second-best contract will always benefit the principal if the strategy profile is symmetric. Instead, when the profile (first or second best) is asymmetric the principal's interest might be better served by self-interested agents. We conclude the paper by clarifying when symmetric profiles are most likely to arise. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin / Boston 2014.},

abstract={Abstract: In the Mediterranean landscape fires are common, sometimes arising due to human activity. Fire influences the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground, thus affecting the diversity and distribution of animal and plant species. In this study, we analysed the effect of fire on butterfly diversity at the Site of Community Importance (SCI) “Monti di Lauro” (IT8040013) in southern Italy (Campania). The area covers 7040 ha and is mainly characterised by Mediterranean maquis and woody vegetation. We compared the flight activity of butterflies before and after a fire incident in October 2008. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and 2009. From the transect data, we calculated several diversity indices. We surveyed 55 species and 5052 individuals (2008: 43 species, 1764 individuals; 2009: 49 species, 3288 individuals). Inter-year comparisons showed that richness was significantly lower in 2008 than in 2009, as well as the abundance; the evenness index was significantly higher in 2008 than in 2009. Intra-year comparisons before fire (2008) showed significant differences among months in all indices analysed, whereas after fire (2009), only evenness differed significantly. Our results show that after fire in the Mediterranean maquis, a rapid change in butterfly community structure occurred, increasing both species and individual abundance. Nevertheless, a lower evenness indicates a less balanced butterfly community after fire. Notably, Melanargia arge, a protected species by the Habitats Directive, was not observed following the fire. © 2014, © 2014 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

abstract={Since 2008, eurozone sovereign yields have diverged sharply, and so have the corresponding credit default swap (CDS) premia. At the same time, banks' sovereign debt portfolios have featured an increasing home bias. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks' sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2007-13 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the eurozone, and especially in its periphery, banks' sovereign exposures respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country and common risk components of yields, it turns out that (1) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not; (2) in most eurozone countries banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (1) suggests distorted incentives in periphery banks' response to changes in their own sovereign's risk. Finding (2) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the eurozone sovereign market more segmented. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2014.},

abstract={Using data for 9, 13 and 15-year-old students from three different datasets (PIRLS-2006, TIMSS-2007 and PISA-2009), we investigate whether the age at school entry affects children school performance at the fourth, eighth and tenth grade levels. Since student's age in a grade may be endogenous, we use an instrumental variable estimation strategy exploiting the exogenous variations in the month of birth coupled with the entry school cut-off date. We find that younger children score substantially lower than older peers at the fourth, the eighth and the tenth grade. The advantage of older students does not dissipate as they grow older. We do not find any significant effect of the relative age of a child with respect to the classmates' age. Finally, we show that secondary school students are more likely to be tracked in more academic schools rather than in vocational schools if they are born in the early months of the year. From a policy point of view our results suggest that it might be useful to postpone the entry at school of children, or at least pupils should be prevented to anticipate the age of their entry at school. Tracking should also be delayed. © 2014.},

abstract={Objectives of this paper is to verify whether the relationship between the level of per capita income and the environment quality, for the Italian regions, follows the prescription of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), taking into account the contribution of agriculture and rural areas. The Arellano-Bond two-step dynamic panel data GMM estimator has been applied to a data set of the 20 Italian administrative regions referred to the 2000-2006 period. The environment quality is represented by the level of per capita CO2 emissions from the whole economy and by the level of per capita CO2 emissions from agriculture. The regression results show that i) the EKC prescription holds for the Italian regions, ii) the more agricultural regions are found on the rising section of the curve; iii) a greater intensity of expenditure, under the RDP regional agro-environmental and forestry measures, is positively associated to a more degraded environment.},

abstract={Using a large sample of retail investors as well as experimental data we find that risk and ambiguity aversion are positively correlated. We provide evidence that a common link is decision mode: intuitive thinkers tolerate more risk and ambiguity than effortful reasoners. One interpretation is that intuitive thinking confers an advantage in risky or ambiguous situations. We present supporting lab and field evidence that intuitive thinkers outperform others in uncertain environments. Finally, we find that risk and ambiguity aversion vary with individual characteristics and wealth. The wealthy are less risk averse but more ambiguity averse, which has implications for financial puzzles. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to better understand how mandatory risk categories are disclosed and to provide a better understanding of the reasons why risk disclosure looks less useful than it ought to be. Design/methodology/approach – We analyze how Italian banks provide risk information, by focusing on its characteristics to find out any differences between the notes to the financial statements and the public report, both prepared in compliance with the instructions of the Bank of Italy. We assess the risk-related reporting practices of 66 Italian banks, based on a content analysis of the two mandatory reports, and verify whether bank-specific factors explain any differences. Findings – Italian banks formally comply with the Bank of Italy’s instructions, but there is discretion to choose the characteristics of the information provided. Despite different risk categories to disclose in each report, disclosure is quite uniform, although banks tend to provide denser information in the notes to the financial statements and the difference in the economic signs between the two reports decreases as the level of risk increases. Practical implications – The significance of this study goes beyond the debate taking place in the academic arena, as it can be largely relevant for preparers, those responsible for setting international and national accounting standards, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the domestic supervisory authorities, particularly concerning the possible introduction of requirements that are more explicit than the existing ones. Originality/value – The Italian setting is very relevant because unlike other countries, Italy adopts “interventionist enforcements”, which are regarded as a critical tool for achieving the minimum disclosure requirements. Moreover, the two sets of disclosure required by the Bank of Italy have never been investigated in a single data set. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={An agronomic research was conducted in Tuscany (Central Italy) to evaluate the effects of an advanced irrigation system on the water use efficiency (WUE) of a tomato crop and to investigate the ability of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry to detect and map WUE. Irrigation was applied following an innovative approach based on CropSense system. Soil water content was monitored at four soil depths (10, 20, 30 and 50cm) by a probe. Rainfall during the crop cycle reached 162mm and irrigation water applied with a drip system amounted to 207mm, distributed with 16 irrigation events. Tomato yield varied from 7.10 to 14.4kgm-2, with a WUE ranging from 19.1 to 38.9kgm-3. The irrigation system allowed a high yield levels and a low depth of water applied, as compared to seasonal ET crop estimated with Hargraves' formula and with the literature data on irrigated tomato. Measurements were carried out on geo-referenced points to gather information on crop (crop yield, eighteen Vegetation indices, leaf area index) and on soil (spectroradiometric and traditional analysis). Eight VIs, out of nineteen ones analyzed, showed a significant relationship with georeferenced yield data; PVI maps seemed able to return the best response, before harvesting, to improve the knowledge of the area of cultivation and irrigation system. CropSense irrigation system reduced seasonal irrigation volumes. Some vegetation indexes were significantly correlated to tomato yield and well identify, a posteriori, crop area with low WUE; spectroradiometry can be a valuable tool to improve irrigated tomato field management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The literature on inter-firm collaboration primarily concentrates on successful cases and tries to explain why and how they obtained their success. On the other hand, there are fewer contributions that study the reasons for inter-firm relationships failure. This paper responds to that deficiency by providing evidence as to why inter-firm collaboration fails, and identifies processes where it is possible to pass from a difficult and complex relationship (where mutual trust is not notably present) to situations of recovery and re-positioning. Empirical evidence is presented from two specific areas in the Campania Region (Italy) to test a proposed theoretical model that identifies the importance of partners' previous experience and their awareness of the importance of inter-firm cooperation as determinants of the survival and success of the collaboration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Using data from an Italian University, we relate student evaluations of teaching quality to the physical attractiveness of instructors (as evaluated by external raters using photos), controlling for a number of teacher and course characteristics. We first show that teachers' beauty significantly affects evaluations of their teaching. We carry out a number of checks to tackle threats to internal validity: course fixed effects and individual research productivity are controlled for; an IV estimation strategy is undertaken using a second measure of beauty as an instrument; and measures of grooming and fastidiousness are introduced. Notwithstanding these controls, we find that more attractive teachers receive much better evaluations.},

abstract={Rankings and partial rankings are ubiquitous in data analysis, yet there is relatively little work in the classification community that uses the typical properties of rankings. We review the broader literature that we are aware of, and identify a common building block for both prediction of rankings and clustering of rankings, which is also valid for partial rankings. This building block is the Kemeny distance, defined as the minimum number of interchanges of two adjacent elements required to transform one (partial) ranking into another. The Kemeny distance is equivalent to Kendall's τ for complete rankings, but for partial rankings it is equivalent to Emond and Mason's extension of τ. For clustering, we use the flexible class of methods proposed by Ben-Israel and Iyigun (Journal of Classification 25: 5-26, 2008), and define the disparity between a ranking and the center of cluster as the Kemeny distance. For prediction, we build a prediction tree by recursive partitioning, and define the impurity measure of the subgroups formed as the sum of all within-node Kemeny distances. The median ranking characterizes subgroups in both cases. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract={The present study aims to calculate the expected insurance premium for Italian building stock subjected to seismic hazard in its service lifetime based on probabilistic loss estimation. A methodology is presented that takes into account the uncertainty in the occurrence of future events due to seismic hazard. The expected insurance premium can then be evaluated based on the probabilities that the structure exceeds a set of discrete limit state thresholds. Finally, the methodology is implemented in an illustrative numerical example which considers the Italian residential building stock discretized in 5 structural typologies and in 8088 areas, corresponding to the Italian municipalities. An insurance model assuming monopoly market is built, assuming risk aversion of the property owners and risk neutrality of the insurance companies. Hence, the insurance premium is evaluated for each structural typology in each Italian municipality, also considering maximum coverage and insurance excess systems. Results are aggregated to compute the total expected loss per year of the whole Italian building stock, the total income and profit of the insurance company, assuming an insurance contract for all the property owners. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={This paper tests the relationship between time preferences and crime rates as posited by Davis (1988), whose theoretical analysis suggests that individuals' attitude towards the future significantly affects their propensity to commit crime. Our empirical analysis is based on a panel of Italian regions from 2003 to 2007. Various proxies for time preferences are considered: the consumer credit share out of the total amount of loans to households, the share of obese individuals out of the total population, the rate of marriages out of the total population, and the teenage pregnancy rate. Controlling for a great number of factors suggested by the scientific literature on the determinants of crime, adding to the model also time and regional fixed effects, and clustering standard errors to account for both serial and panel correlations, our results basically provide support to the 'Davis' hypothesis' for property crimes, while for violent crimes there seems to be less evidence that these are higher where people discount the future more heavily. Moreover, there is no evidence of a reverse effect from crime to time preferences at this aggregate level. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Using a representative sample of Italian investors, we measure the uncertainty of social security benefits by eliciting for each individual the subjective distribution of the replacement rate as a summary indicator of pension uncertainty. We find that pension uncertainty varies across individuals in a way that is consistent with what one would expect a priori, given different information sets and pension schemes. In particular, individuals who are a long way from retirement, and thus face more career uncertainty, report more subjective pension uncertainty. Since expectations reveal information about people's understanding of pension reforms, our findings suggest that they should also be an important determinant of how people respond to reforms. © The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2013.},

abstract={This chapter highlights some features of the current structure of Italian agriculture by focusing on the regional patterns of agrarian change. These patterns are followed mainly by comparing the data of the 5th and 6th Census of Agriculture and the data of holdings registered to the Chambers of Commerce. The analysis confirms the Northern-Southern dichotomy of Italian agriculture as the physical and economic dimensions of Northern regions' holdings are appreciably higher than those in the South. Other traits of farms, not usually included in most traditional analyses, help explain that Northern-Southern dichotomy: the farmers' educational level and the ICT availability on farms. The agriculture of Southern regions has been affected less by the structural adjustment and has maintained some traits of more 'traditional' farming. However, important innovations, such as organic farming and direct selling to 'consumers in house', have been adopted more readily by Southern farms. The marked regional duality of Italian agriculture corresponds to the several ways in which farmers and their activities interconnect with territorial development models that have shown a deep regional differentiation. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this paper we explore the effects of bank-borrower physical proximity on price and non-price aspects of small business lending in local credit markets. Along the price dimension, our analysis reveals that interest rates increase with bank-borrower distance and decrease with the distance between borrower and other competing banks. Along the quantity dimension, we observe that more distant borrowers are more likely to experience binding credit limits. We also show that the quantity effects of bank-borrower distance are concentrated among less transparent firms. Our findings are consistent with pricing based on marginal costs that reflect information-based factors, and are in contrast to the established paradigm, where banks adopt spatial discriminatory pricing rules when lending to small-sized enterprises. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Using data from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (2006-PIRLS) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (2007-TIMSS), we investigate the determinants and the effect of being a victim of school bullying on educational achievement for Italian students enrolled at the fourth and eighth grade levels. Firstly, we apply an OLS estimator controlling for a number of individual characteristics and school fixed effects. Secondly, in order to attenuate the impact of confounding factors, we use propensity score matching techniques. Our empirical findings based on average treatment effects suggest that being a victim of school bullying has a considerable negative effect on student performance at both the fourth and the eighth grade level. Importantly, the adverse effect of bullying on educational achievement is larger at age 13 than at age 9. Hence, school violence seems to constitute a relevant factor in explaining student performance. Our findings suggest some possible interventions that Italian policy makers should adopt to prevent or reduce bullying behaviors. © 2013 Society for Policy Modeling.},

abstract={Background: The oral mucosa in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) can be affected with different lesions and degrees of severity. However, patterns of oral lesions in distinct types of EB are still unclear. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and distribution of four types of lesions (erythema, erosion, atrophy, and blister) for each oral site and to calculate the interobserver reliability for each type of lesion in each site. Methods: Ninety-two patients with different EB types were assessed independently by an oral medicine specialist and a dermatologist. The degree of agreement was calculated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The most affected oral site was the tongue, with the most frequent lesion being erythema and atrophy [54(58.7%) patients] for the oral medicine specialist and erosion [54(58.7%) patients] for the dermatologist. Patients with recessive dystrophic EB-severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen) showed the highest mean of sites involved by each lesion for both oral medicine and dermatology. The interobserver reliability on the total of lesions was excellent on only 3 sites: lower lip (ICC: 0.89; 95%CI:0.83-0.92), hard palate (ICC:0.85; 95%CI:0.72-0.91), and tongue (ICC:0.89; 95%CI:0.84-0.92), whereas the interobserver reliability calculated for each single oral lesion showed a lower agreement. Conclusion: Total distribution of sites involved by four types of lesions was higher in RDEB-sev gen than in the rest of EB types, with a predominance of erythema followed by erosion. The agreement on the type of lesion was found to be poor-moderate for many oral sites. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={We model the climate change issue as a pollution control game with the purpose of comparing two possible departures from the business as usual (BAU) where countries noncooperatively choose their emission levels. In the first scenario, players have to agree on a global emission cap (GEC) that is enforced by a uniform taxation scheme. They still behave strategically when choosing emission levels but are now subject to the coupled constraint imposed by the cap. The second scenario consists of the implementation of an international cap and trade (ICT) system. In this case, players decide on their emission quotas, and emission trading is allowed. A three heterogenous player quadratic game serves as a basis for the analysis. When the cap is binding, among all the coupled constraints Nash equilibria, we select a particular normalized equilibrium by solving a variational inequality. Comparing the normalized equilibrium with the Nash equilibria of the BAU and the ICT, we first show that if the cap is appropriately chosen, then the GEC system improves all players' payoffs, relative to the BAU. The GEC system may thus be unanimously approved whereas the ICT is not, because moving from the BAU to the ICT is costly for one player. Second, for some values of the cap, all players get a higher payoff under the GEC than under the ICT. Therefore, the GEC outperforms the ICT both in terms of feasibility and efficiency. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={We construct a risk management index (RMI) to measure the strength and independence of the risk management function at bank holding companies (BHCs). The U.S. BHCs with higher RMI before the onset of the financial crisis have lower tail risk, lower nonperforming loans, and better operating and stock return performance during the financial crisis years. Over the period 1995 to 2010, BHCs with a higher lagged RMI have lower tail risk and higher return on assets, all else equal. Overall, these results suggest that a strong and independent risk management function can curtail tail risk exposures at banks. © 013 the American Finance Association.},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to provide some new cooperative characterizations and optimality properties of competitive equilibria supported by non-linear prices. The general framework is that of economies whose commodity space is an ordered topological vector space which need not be a vector lattice. The central notion of equilibrium is the one of personalized equilibrium introduced by Aliprantis et al. (J Econ Theory 100:22-72, 2001). Following Herves-Beloso and Moreno-Garcia (J Math Econ 44:697-706, 2008), the veto power of the grand coalition is exploited in the original economy and in a suitable family of economies associated to the original one. The use of Aubin coalitions allows us to connect results with the arbitrage free condition due to non-linear supporting prices. The use of rational allocations allows us to dispense with Lyapunov convexity theorem. Applications are provided in connection with strategic market games and economies with asymmetric information. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.},

In order to prove the existence of essential Nash equilibria in such spaces, we provide new results on the Ky Fan minimax inequality. In the setting of potential games, we show that games with essential Nash equilibria are the generic case when their potentials satisfy a condition called weak upper pseudocontinuity that is weaker than upper semicontinuity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The expected life-cycle cost can be regarded as a benchmark variable in decision making problems involving insurance policy making for existing structures in seismic risk prone areas. The present study is a preliminary study aiming to calculate the expected insurance premium for Italian building stock subjected to seismic action in its service lifetime based on probabilistic seismic loss assessment. The proposed methodology leads to probabilistic assessment of the structural performance, expressed in terms of the discrete structural limit state exceedance probabilities, and the life cycle cost taking into account the Italian seismic zonation and the seismic vulnerability of the existing life stock. The expected insurance premium can then be evaluated based on the probabilities that the structure exceeds a set of discrete limit state thresholds and the average costs associated to them. The methodology is implemented in an illustrative numerical example which considers the Italian residential building stock discretized in 5 structural typologies and in 8088 areas, corresponding to the Italian municipalities. A monopoly market-based insurance model is built, assuming risk aversion of the property owners and risk neutrality of the insurance companies. The expected insurance premium is evaluated for each structural typology in each Italian municipality, taking into account also the maximum coverage and the insurance excess systems. Results are aggregated to compute the total annual expected loss for the entire Italian building stock, and the total income and profit margin for the insurance company assuming an insurance contract for all the property owners. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Fifty BMS patients were compared with an equal number of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and educational level. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) were administered. Descriptive statistics, including the Mann-Whitney U test and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were used. BMS patients had higher scores in all items of the PSQI and ESS than the healthy controls (P < .001). In the BMS patients, a depressed mood and anxiety correlated positively with sleep disturbances. The Pearson correlations were 0.68 for PSQI vs HAM-D (P < .001) and 0.63 for PSQI vs HAM-A (P < .001). BMS patients reported a greater degree of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression as compared with controls. Sleep disorders could influence quality of life of BMS patients and could be a possible treatment target.},

abstract={We present an intertemporal consumption model of investment in financial literacy. Consumers benefit from such investment because financial literacy allows them to increase the returns on wealth. Since literacy depreciates over time and has a cost in terms of current consumption, the model delivers an optimal investment in literacy. Furthermore, literacy and wealth are determined jointly, and are positively correlated over the life-cycle. The model drives our empirical approach to the analysis of the effect of financial literacy on wealth and saving and indicates that the stock of financial literacy early in life is a valid instrument in the regression of wealth on financial literacy. Using microeconomic and aggregate data, we find strong support for the model's predictions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We analyze the relationship between legal institutions, innovation, and growth. We compare a rigid legal system (the law is set before the technological innovation) and a flexible one (the law is set after observing the new technology). The flexible system dominates in terms of welfare, amount of innovation, and output growth at intermediate stages of technological development-periods when legal change is needed. The rigid system is preferable at early stages of technological development, when commitment problems are severe. For mature technologies, the two legal systems are equivalent. We find that rigid legal systems may induce excessive R&D investment. © (2013) by the Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania and the Osaka University Institute of Social and Economic Research Association.},

abstract={The paper aims at presenting some statistical exploratory methods useful in the joint analysis of data collected in a survey, by means of closed and open-ended questions. After a quick review of the main steps necessary for transforming texts in a numerical table, we focus our attention on Lexical Correspondence Analysis. This method is a popular technique for analysing a lexical table obtained by cross-classifying respondents and free responses. As our interest is often in measuring and visualising the association between socio-demographic characteristics and lexical behaviour, the modalities of one or more closed-ended questions are used both for aggregating individuals similar with respect to the considered variables and reducing the sparseness of the lexical table. Dealing with textual data, the effectiveness of a non symmetrical variant of correspondence analysis is introduced. Furthermore, the advantages of asking a free description of the desired product in a conjoint analysis questionnaire is shown, by applying a factorial conjoint analysis with the lexical table as external information. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract={This paper shows that during episodes of market turmoil, 13F institutional investors with short trading horizons sell their stockholdings to a larger extent than 13F institutional investors with longer trading horizons. This creates price pressure for stocks held mostly by short-horizon investors, which, as a consequence, experience larger price drops, and subsequent reversals, than stocks held mostly by long-horizon investors. These findings, obtained after controlling for the withdrawals experienced by the investors, are not driven by other institutional investors' and firms' characteristics. Overall, the evidence indicates that investors with short horizons amplify the effects of market-wide negative shocks by demanding liquidity at times when other potential buyers'capital is scarce. © 2013 The Author.

abstract={In this paper, we analyze class size effects on college students exploiting data from a project offering special remedial courses in mathematics and language skills to freshmen enrolled at an Italian medium-sized public university. To estimate the effects of class size, we exploit the fact that students and teachers are virtually randomly assigned to teaching classes of different sizes. From our analysis, it emerges that controlling for a number of individual characteristics, larger classes determine a significant and sizeable negative effect on student performance in mathematics. Importantly, this negative effect is significantly larger for low-ability students and negligible for high-ability ones. On the other hand, class size effects do not appear to be relevant for student achievement in language skills. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We provide a theoretical and empirical study of the relation between financial development and the size of the underground economy. In our theoretical framework agents allocate investment between a low-return technology which can be operated with internal funds, and a high-return technology which requires external finance. Firms can reduce the cost of funding by disclosing part or all of their assets and pledging them as collateral. The disclosure decision, however, also involves higher tax payments and reduces tax evasion. We show that financial development (a reduction in the cost of external finance) can reduce tax evasion and the size of the underground economy. We test the main implications of the model using Italian microeconomic data that allow us to construct a micro-based index of the underground economy. In line with the model's predictions, we find that local financial development is associated with a smaller size of the underground economy, controlling for the potential endogeneity of financial development and other determinants of the underground economy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={This paper studies the effect of intention-based reciprocity preferences on the free-riding problem arising in partnerships. Our results suggest a tendency of efficient partnerships to consist of members whose sensitivity to reciprocity is - individually or jointly - sufficiently high. Sufficient conditions for the implementation of the efficient strategy profile require a reciprocity-based sharing rule so that each partner gets a fraction of the output, which is a percentage of his own sensitivity to reciprocity with respect to the overall sensitivity in the team. Finally, we introduce the concept of psychological strong Nash equilibrium and show that it allows for the unique and collusion-proof implementation of the efficient strategy profile. © 2012 University of Venice.},

Calibrating the model to Italian auditing data, we provide an estimate of tax evasion based on (non-random) audit data alone.

abstract={Most regulators around the world reacted to the 2007-09 crisis by imposing bans on short selling. These were imposed and lifted at different dates in different countries, often targeted different sets of stocks, and featured varying degrees of stringency. We exploit this variation in short-sales regimes to identify their effects on liquidity, price discovery, and stock prices. Using panel and matching techniques, we find that bans (i) were detrimental for liquidity, especially for stocks with small capitalization and no listed options; (ii) slowed price discovery, especially in bear markets, and (iii) failed to support prices, except possibly for U.S. financial stocks. © 2013 The American Finance Association.},

abstract={The topic of interest rate restrictions and their legal implications represents a delicate subject about which a recent inventory of EU authorities was developed. This is aimed to inspection of the so called principle of "good morals" against usury for the Member States. The most recent Italian law regulating legal rates of interest applied in loans, sets a threshold under which loan interest rates have to remain for being nonusurious, in the sense that if the loan rate lies outside the threshold, it becomes a usury rate and has to be prosecuted. The threshold is stated by Bank of Italy precisely each three-month period. In the paper the authors propose a stochastic process modelling the non-usurious interest rates applied in loans, in order to control its quarterly behavior. It is studied in the form of a modification of the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross model moving between two bands and closed expressions for its expected value and variance are given both conditional and unconditional. The model parameters are estimated by the Indirect Inference Method; the behavior of the expected value and variance functions are illustrated with graphs. © Emilia Di Lorenzo, Albina Orlando, Marilena Sibillo, 2013.},

abstract={Visualization and Forecasting of time series data is difficult when the data are very numerous, with complex structures as, for example, in the presence of high volatility and structural changes. This is the case of high frequency data or, in general, of financial data, where we cannot clearly visualize the single data and where the necessity of an aggregation arises. In this paper we deal with the specific problem of forecasting beanplot time series. We propose an approach based firstly on a parameterization of the beanplot time series and successively on the chosen best forecasting method with respect to our data. In particular we experiment with a strategy to use combination forecast methods in order to improve the forecasting performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Background: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a genetic mucocutaneous disorder characterized by blister formation upon mild trauma. All 4 EB types may show oropharyngeal lesions involving either hard or soft tissues. Currently, there are very few data on EB scoring that include the oropharyngeal cavity. Objectives: We sought to develop an oropharyngeal severity score that was objective, valid, reliable, reproducible, easy to perform, and appropriate for all EB types. Methods: In this study, oral medicine specialists developed a new score, the EB Oropharyngeal Severity (EBOS) score. This measured oropharyngeal disease activity (erythema, atrophy, blisters, erosion/ulceration) and structural damage (microstomia, ankyloglossia, scarring phenotype beyond microstomia and ankyloglossia, enamel hypoplasia). It was tested on 92 patients with different types/subtypes of EB, and interobserver and intraobserver reliability were assessed. Results: The EBOS mean total score was 12.9 ± 10.9 (range: 0-34). Both interobserver and intraobserver reliability for total score on all patients with EB were considered excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.96 and intraclass correlation coefficient 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.94, respectively). Even analyzing each single parameter of the disease activity and structural damage, a substantial to excellent correlation was found in the interobserver (except for 4 sites) and intraobserver reliability. A significant correlation was found between EB types/subtypes and the EBOS median score (P < .001), but not between age and the EBOS mean total score in each group. Limitations: The sample size was small and the number of EB subtypes was limited. Conclusions: The EBOS score seems to represent an instrument capable of truly quantifying the oropharyngeal severity in different types/subtypes of EB, demonstrating excellent interobserver and intraobserver reliability. © 2012 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.},

abstract={Healthcare utilization studies show how well documented disparities between migrants and non-migrants. Reducing such disparities is a major goal in European countries. However, healthcare utilization among Italian immigrants is under-studied. The objective of this study is to explore differences in healthcare use between immigrant and native Italians. Cross-sectional study using the latest available (2004/2005) Italian Health Conditions Survey. We estimated separate hurdle binomial negative regression models for GP, specialist, and telephone consultations and a logit model for emergency room (ER) use. We used logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression to model the zero (contact decision) and count processes (frequency decisions) respectively. Adjusting for risk factors, immigrants are significantly less likely to use healthcare services with 2. 4 and 2. 7 % lower utilization probability for specialist and telephone consultations, respectively. First- and second-generation immigrants' probability for specialist and telephone contact is significantly lower than natives'. Immigrants, ceteris paribus, have a much higher probability of using ERs than natives (0. 7 %). First-generation immigrants show a higher probability of visiting ERs (1 %). GP visits show no significant difference. In conclusion Italian immigrants are much less likely to use specialist healthcare and medical telephone consultations than natives but more likely to use ERs. Hence, we report an over-use of ERs and under-utilization of preventive care among immigrants. We recommend improved health policies for immigrants: promotion of better information dissemination among them, simplification of organizational procedures, better communications between providers and immigrants, and an increased supply of health services for the most disadvantaged populations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={A puzzling but consistent result in the empirical literature on banking is that firms with close bank ties do not grow faster than bank-independent firms. In this paper, we reconsider the link between relationship lending and firm growth, distinguishing firms by size and expansion/contraction conditions. The idea is that the beneficial effects of relationship lending on information asymmetries can be compensated by other negative capture, risk, and externality effects which make relational banks reluctant to support long-term growth projects of client firms, and that the strength of these compensating effects varies with firm size and health status. We explore the influence of long-lasting bank relationships on employment and asset growth of a large sample of Italian firms. The main finding is that relationship lending hampers the efforts of small firms to increase their size, while it mitigates the negative growth of troubled, medium-large enterprises. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of longevity risk sharing between an annuity provider and the annuitants. In this field, the idea of reducing the annuity periodic payments in similar way to what happens in the context of securitization is gaining. In the following the authors refer to a contract in which the installments of life annuities are scaled by a demographic index. The main finding is that, scaling the periodic installments, would result in a significant reduction in the level of benefits. The conditions that allow to limit the reduction of benefits without worsening the insurer's position is investigated. The conclusion is that it is possible to achieve an equilibrium not only reducing the amount of the periodic installments but also moving forward the retirement age. © Albina Orlando, Massimiliano Politano, 2013.},

abstract={We present optimality conditions for bilevel optimal control problems where the upper level is a scalar optimal control problem to be solved by a leader and the lower level is a multiobjective convex optimal control problem to be solved by several followers acting in a cooperative way inside the greatest coalition and choosing amongst efficient optimal controls. We deal with the so-called optimistic case, when the followers are assumed to choose the best choice for the leader amongst their best responses, as well with the so-called pessimistic case, when the best response chosen by the followers can be the worst choice for the leader. This paper continues the research initiated in Bonnel (SIAM J. Control Optim. 50(6), 3224-3241, 2012) where existence results for these problems have been obtained. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to analyze the performance of a portfolio of participating life annuities, focusing on the minimum acceptable income level throughout the quantiles of the return distribution. The model, in addition to the necessary consideration of the volatility of financial markets, gives a central role to the impact of the longevity phenomenon. The sensitivity of the portfolio performance to the survival projection, the presence of a break-even point and the time of optimum performance are pointed out, under different hypotheses for the participating quota and with stochastic assumption for the accumulation and the discounting financial processes and for the survival description. © Authors, 2013.},

abstract={We consider a bilevel optimal control problem where the upper level, to be solved by a leader, is a scalar optimal control problem, and the lower level, to be solved by several followers, is a multiobjective convex optimal control problem. We deal with the so-called optimistic case, when the followers are assumed to choose a best choice for the leader among their best responses, as well with the so-called pessimistic case, when the best response chosen by the followers can be the worst choice for the leader. First, the strategy of the leader fixed, we state a relationship between the (weakly or properly) efficient set of the follower's multicriteria problem and the solution set of the problem scalarized via a convex combination of objectives through a vector of parameters (weights). Then we establish that (i) the solution of the scalarized (parametric) problem for any given parameter vector is unique and (weakly or properly) efficient and (ii) for each solution in the (weakly or properly) efficient set, there exists at least one corresponding parameter vector for the scalarized problem yielding the same solution. Therefore, the set of all parametric solutions (obtained by solving the scalarized problem) is equal to the efficient set. Thus we are able to rewrite the optimistic and pessimistic semivectorial bilevel control problems as bilevel problems where the lower level is a scalar optimization problem which always admits a unique solution. Finally, we present sufficient conditions on the data for existence of solutions to both the optimistic and pessimistic optimal control problems. Copyright © by SIAM.},

abstract={Referring to the Solvency II regulation, aim of the paper is to obtain an estimate for the Solvency Capital Requirement of a life annuity portfolio when stochastic interest and mortality rates are considered. We propose a computationally tractable approach that yields an estimate for the required solvency capital when mortality and interest rates are forecasted by means of diffusion processes. To this aim we determine the capital requirements for each considered risk factor and then we compute the Global Solvency Capital Requirement. Numerical applications analyzing the effect of the choice of different scenarios on the Global SCR quantification are proposed. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2012.},

abstract={Understanding the determinants of the demand for goods, which have been produced according to ethical considerations and marketed accordingly, has become an important research area in business economics. Less clear is the role that the social environment plays in shaping the preferences for ethically produced goods. Our main objective is to fill this gap in the literature by quantifying the extent to which the social capital generated by the presence of co-operatives in an area can have an impact on the consumers' motivations to buy ethically produced goods by using a sample of 889 individuals who have visited one of the retailers specialized in the distribution of ethically produced goods in four Italian regions. Our results show that the presence of co-operatives in an area has a positive influence on the consumers' preferences for fair trade goods. Copyright © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The paper deals with the solvency analysis through internal models in the case of a portfolio of life annuities, focusing on the interplay between stochastic interest rate dynamics and the survival evolution in time. This specific aspect is investigated basing the survival death rates on Poisson Lee Carter model approached according to the Iterative Procedure and two simulated approaches on the Poisson Lee Carter: the Standard Procedure and the Stratified Sampling Procedure. The financial aspect, particularly notable in portfolios with long duration and multiplicity of payments as in the considered case, is tackled assuming different stochastic hypotheses on the interest rates evolution. Aim of the paper is to deepen the reaction of solvency measures as the surplus index and the ruin probability to the specific financial and demographic scenario. The indexes are studied in different loading factor assumptions and several numerical applications illustrate the model setup. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2012.},

abstract={In the last decades the use of regression-like preference models has found widespread application in marketing research. The Conjoint Analysis models have even more been used to analyze consumer preferences and simulate product positioning. The typical data structure of this kind of models can be enriched by the presence of supplementary information observed on respondents. We suppose that relational data observed on pairs of consumers are available. In such a case, the existence of a consumer network is introduced in the Conjoint model as a set of contiguous constraints among the respondents. The proposed approach will allow to bring together the theoretical framework of Social Network Analysis with the explicative power of Conjoint Analysis models. The combined use of relational and choice data could be usefully exploited in the framework of relational and tribal marketing strategies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Aim of the study was the analysis of powered two-wheeler (PTW) crashes in Italy in order to detect interdependence as well as dissimilarities among crash characteristics and provide insights for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on PTWs. At this aim, data mining techniques were used to analyze the data relative to the 254,575 crashes involving PTWs occurred in Italy in the period 2006-2008. Classification trees analysis and rules discovery were performed. Tree-based methods are non-linear and non-parametric data mining tools for supervised classification and regression problems. They do not require a priori probabilistic knowledge about the phenomena under studying and consider conditional interactions among input data. Rules discovery is the identification of sets of items (i.e., crash patterns) that occur together in a given event (i.e., a crash in our study) more often than they would if they were independent of each other. Thus, the method can detect interdependence among crash characteristics. Due to the large number of patterns considered, both methods suffer from an extreme risk of finding patterns that appear due to chance alone. To overcome this problem, in our study we randomly split the sample data in two data sets and used well-established statistical practices to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Both the classification trees and the rules discovery were effective in providing meaningful insights about PTW crash characteristics and their interdependencies. Even though in several cases different crash characteristics were highlighted, the results of the two the analysis methods were never contradictory. Furthermore, most of the findings of this study were consistent with the results of previous studies which used different analytical techniques, such as probabilistic models of crash injury severity. Basing on the analysis results, engineering countermeasures and policy initiatives to reduce PTW injuries and fatalities were singled out. The simultaneous use of classification trees and association discovery must not, however, be seen as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method which can be integrated into other safety analyses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We estimate a remittance model in which we address endogeneity and reverse causality relationships between immigrants' remittances, pre-transfer income and consumption. In order to take into account the fact that a large share of individuals do not remit, instrumental variable variants of the double-hurdle and Heckit selection models are proposed and estimated by Limited Information ML; semiparametric extensions are considered as robustness checks. Our results for a sample of recent immigrants to Australia show that endogeneity is substantial and that estimates obtained by the methods previously employed in the literature may be misleading if given a behavioral interpretation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The life-cycle cost can be regarded as a benchmark variable in decision making problems involving insurance policy making for existing structures in seismic risk-prone areas. The present study is a preliminary study aiming to calculate the expected insurance premium for RC building stock in Italy subjected to seismic hazard in its service lifetime based on probabilistic loss estimation. A methodology is presented that takes into account the uncertainty in the occurrence of future events due to seismic hazard. The expected insurance premium can then be evaluated based on the time-dependent probabilities that the structure exceeds a set of discrete limit state thresholds. Finally, the methodology is implemented in an illustrative numerical example which considers the Italian portfolio of RC (reinforced concrete) structures discretized in 2 structural typologies and in the 103 Italian provinces. It is demonstrated how the evaluated premium can be affected by the decision to upgrade the structure.},

abstract={In the wake of the global crisis the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased its exposure to developing countries and modified its lending approach to enhance its crisis prevention role. In this paper we examine whether, during the current crisis, IMF lending was actually directed at preventing the spread of the crisis and whether participation in IMF programs was sensitive to the politico-economic interests of the Fund's main shareholders. We find that the political similarity with G7 countries is positively correlated with the probability of entering a loan agreement, while the harsher the crisis and the exposure of foreign banks in the country, the larger the loan granted by the IMF. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Recent studies indicate that the effect of migrants remittances on the economic growth of receiving countries depends negatively on the level of development of the domestic financial sector. In this paper, we introduce a new indicator of financial development to measure the efficiency of the domestic banking system, and find the existence of complementarity between remittances and bank efficiency in economic growth, such that remittances promote growth only in countries whose banks function well. This result is robust to controls for other traditional measures of financial depth and institutional quality indicators. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={This paper examines the role of credit rating agencies in the subprime crisis thattriggered the 2007-2008 financial turmoil. We focus on two aspects of ratingsthat contributed to the boom and bust of the market for structured debt: ratinginflation and coarse information disclosure. The paper discusses how regulationcan be designed to mitigate these problems in the future. Our preferred policy isto require rating agencies to be paid by investors rather than by issuers and togrant open and free access to data about the loans or securities underlying structureddebt products. A more modest (but less effective) approach would be toretain the 'issuer pays' model but require issuers to pay an upfront fee irrespectiveof the rating, ban 'credit shopping', and prescribe a more complete formatfor the information that rating agencies must disseminate. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2010.},

abstract={We present a model in which issuers of asset-backed securities choose to release coarse information to enhance the liquidity of their primary market, at the cost of reducing secondary market liquidity. The degree of transparency is inefficiently low if the social value of secondary market liquidity exceeds its private value. We show that various types of public intervention (mandatory transparency standards, provision of liquidity to distressed banks, or secondary market price support) have quite different welfare implications. Finally, we extend the model by endogenizing the private and social value of liquidity and the proportion of sophisticated investors. © The Author 2012.},

abstract={Framework of this paper is statistical data editing, specifically how to edit or impute missing or contradictory data and how to merge two independent data sets presenting some lack of information. Assuming a missing at random mechanism, this paper provides an accurate tree-based methodology for both missing data imputation and data fusion that is justified within the Statistical Learning Theory of Vapnik. It considers both an incremental variable imputation method to improve computational efficiency as well as boosted trees to gain in prediction accuracy with respect to other methods. As a result, the best approximation of the structural risk (also known as irreducible error) is reached, thus reducing at minimum the generalization (or prediction) error of imputation. Moreover, it is distribution free, it holds independently of the underlying probability law generating missing data values. Performance analysis is discussed considering simulation case studies and real world applications. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the determinants of on-the-job search activities of Italian workers. Using several waves of the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), a Probit model is used to estimate how individual socio-demographic characteristics and economic variables affect the probability of on-the-job search. We find that the probability of being engaged in job search activities is higher for low wage earners, for workers with low tenure and higher levels of education, for males, and for residents in large cities. Moreover, we find significant differences in the determinants of on-the-job search activities across sectors. Public sector employees show a considerably lower probability of on-the-job search compared to private sector workers. White collar workers and teachers search much less than blue collar workers. Results suggest that, even controlling for wage levels, the attractiveness of jobs varies considerably. © 2012 International Journal of the Economics of Business.},

abstract={This article contributes to the literature on local tax interactions. Its novelty lies in its focus on the interactions of local governments across national borders. We use panel data for the French and German municipalities in the Rhine Valley for the period 2000-2007. The local governments of each country influence firms' overall tax burdens, but the tax instruments available at the local level differ. We estimate panel models that distinguish between the effects of competing municipalities belonging to the same country and belonging to the other country. Our empirical model shows that local jurisdictions along borders choose their business tax rates based on those of their domestic neighbors and that foreign fiscal policy does not have an impact on the local domestic tax setting behavior in these contexts. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper analyses how information acquisition and transmission on the upstream cost affect the optimal access profit-sharing plan and the regulator's choice of an information transmission regime in network industries characterized by a regulated upstream monopoly with cost uncertainty and an unregulated downstream duopoly. When the regulator obliges the upstream monopolist to transmit information to a downstream rival, the adoption of an access profit-sharing plan may boost his/her incentives to acquire information. It will be shown that the optimal access profit-sharing plan under information transmission depends on the variance and shape of cost distribution. Moreover, an information transmission regime proves to be welfare preferable to a regime with no information transmission only if it induces information acquisition and if the regulator is significantly concerned about firms' profits. © 2011 University of Venice.},

abstract={We study how vertical integration affects the acquisition and transmission of demand information in regulated network industries. Demand information helps to set the access price, incentivize infrastructure investment, and foster competition in the unregulated downstream market. We show that when demand information is costly and private, the optimal access prices are independent of demand levels. Vertical integration then secures greater welfare in new markets where little demand information is available or where infrastructure cost is low, or when investing is highly risky. In the remaining cases, vertical separation is preferable. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Objective of this paper is to analyse the presence of gender differences in the purchase motivations of Fair Trade (FT) food products sold in the Italian World Shops (WS). At the end of investigating FT purchase motivations, a questionnaire has been distributed to a sample of consumers in four Italian regions. A bivariate ordered probit analysis has been performed in order to identify the determinants of the two main ethical purchase motivations: worker guarantees and solidarity. The variables used as determinants are individual and municipal characteristics. Among individual characteristics, gender is significant; among the municipal characteristics, the rate of female labor force participation is also significant. These results give evidence of a gender-based differentiation in the preferences for FT public goods. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) and breast cancer (BC) are the two most common diseases associated with bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ), for which different therapeutical approaches have been proposed. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical behaviour of BRONJ in patients with MM vs. BC and the time of healing in terms of clinical and symptomatological remission, following a standardized therapeutic protocol. Methods: Twenty-six BRONJ patients (13 men with MM and 13 women with BC) were prospectively enroled and treated with a specific systemic and topical antibiotic therapy. Several predictors of outcome were also evaluated. Results: Nine patients (69.2%) with BC and 10 patients (76.9%) with MM progressed towards a complete clinical remission (CR) in a mean healing time of 183.3days [SD: 113.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 95.95-207.7] and 372.0days (SD: 308.0; 95% CI: 151.7-592.3) (P=0.776), respectively. The clinical improvement was statistically significant (P=0.0013 and P=0.0014), as well as the assessment of pain (P=0.0015 and P=0.0015), in MM and BC group, respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed that just triggering events (P=0.036) were found to be significant predictors of outcome of BRONJ healing. Conclusions: Both groups of cancer patients experienced clinical and symptomatological remission regardless their malignancy, but BC patients earlier than MM patients. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={We use two data sets, one from a large brokerage and another from a major bank, to ask: (i) whether financial advisors are more likely to be matched with poorer, uninformed investors or with richer and experienced investors; (ii) how advised accounts actually perform relative to self-managed accounts; (iii) whether the contribution of independent and bank advisors is similar. We find that advised accounts offer on average lower net returns and inferior risk-return tradeoffs (Sharpe ratios). Trading costs contribute to outcomes, as advised accounts feature higher turnover, consistent with commissions being the main source of advisor income. Results are robust to controlling for investor and local area characteristics. The results apply with stronger force to bank advisors than to independent financial advisors, consistent with greater limitations on bank advisory services. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Real markets offer economists several occasions for investigating deviations from the perfect competition scheme. We present some problems arising in consumer theory when deviations are determined by the presence of large traders (monopolies, oligopolies) and/or public goods, and/or uncertainty about possible states of nature on which agents are asymmetrically informed. In all of these cases, considering fuzzy cooperative behavior within a coalition of agents provides cooperative solutions to restore classical results. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={We consider pure exchange economies with finitely many private goods involving the choice of a public project. We discuss core-equivalence results in the general framework of non-Euclidean representation of the collective goods. We define a contribution scheme to capture the fraction of the total cost of providing the project that each blocking coalition is expected to cover. We show that for each given contribution scheme defined over the wider class of Aubin coalitions, the resulting core is equivalent to the corresponding linear cost share equilibria. We also characterize linear cost share equilibria in terms of the veto power of the grand coalition. It turns out that linear cost share equilibria are exactly those allocations that cannot be blocked by the grand coalition with reference to auxiliary economies with the same space of agents and modified initial endowments and cost functions. Unlike the Aubin-type equivalence and results presented in Diamantaras and Gilles (Soc Choice Welf 15:121-139, 1998), this characterization does not depend on a particular contribution scheme. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={How does finance affect employment and inter-industry job reallocation? We present a model that predicts that financial development (i) increases employment and/or labour productivity and wages, with a smaller impact at high levels of the equilibrium wage and financial development; (ii) may induce either more or less reallocation of jobs depending on whether shocks to profit opportunities or to cash flow predominate; (iii) amplifies the output and employment losses in crises, firms that rely most on banks for liquidity being hit the hardest. Testing these predictions on international industry-level data for 1970-2003, we find that standard measures of financial development are indeed associated with greater employment growth, although only in non-OECD countries, and are not correlated with labour productivity or real wage growth. Moreover, they correlate negatively with inter-industry dispersion of employment growth. Finally, there is some evidence of a 'dark side' of financial development, in that during banking crises employment grows less in the industries that are more dependent on external finance and those located in the more financially developed countries. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2012.},

abstract={In many countries, Mutual Loan-Guarantee Societies (MGSs) are assuming ever-increasing importance for small business lending. In this paper we provide a theory to rationalize the raison d'être of MGSs. The basic intuition is that the motivation for MGSs lies in the inefficiencies created by adverse selection, when borrowers do not have enough wealth to satisfy collateral requirements and induce self-selecting contracts. In this setting, we view MGSs as a wealth-pooling mechanism that allows otherwise inefficiently rationed borrowers to obtain credit. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Exploratory analysis was made of data from pedestrian crashes to detect interdependence and dissimilarities between crash patterns and to provide insight for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on pedestrians. Data-mining techniques, such as classification trees and association rules, were used on data related to 56,014 pedestrian crashes that occurred in Italy from 2006 to 2008. Crash severity was the response variable most sensitive to crash patterns. The most influential crash patterns were road type, pedestrian age, lighting conditions, vehicle type, and interactions between these patterns. Notable results included associations between fatal crashes and rural areas, urban provincial and national roads, pedestrians older than 75 years, nighttime conditions, pedestrians older than 65 years in nighttime crashes, drivers' young age and male gender in nighttime crashes, and truck involvement. To mitigate the fatal crash patterns identified by the classification trees and association rules, several measures are suggested for implementation. Results of the study are consistent with results of previous studies that used other analytic techniques, such as probabilistic models of crash injury severity. The data-mining techniques used in the study were able to detect interdependencies among crash characteristics. The use of classification trees and association rules, however, must be seen not as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method that can be integrated into other safety analyses.},

abstract={In this paper we deal with the problem of visualizing and exploring specific time series such as high-frequency financial data. These data present unique features, absent in classical time series, which involve the necessity of searching and analysing an aggregate behaviour. Therefore, we define peculiar aggregated time series called beanplot time series. We show the advantages of using them instead of scalar time series when the data have a complex structure. Furthermore, we underline the interpretative proprieties of beanplot time series by comparing different types of aggregated time series.

abstract={Life insurance companies deal with two fundamental types of risks when issuing annuity contracts: financial risk and demographic risk. Recent work on the latter has focused on modeling the trend in mortality as a stochastic process. A popular method for modeling death rates is the Lee-Carter model. This methodology has become widely used, and various extensions and modifications have been proposed to obtain a broader interpretation and to capture the main features of the dynamics of mortality rates. In order to improve the measurement of uncertainty in survival probability estimates, in particular for older ages, the paper proposes an extension based on simulation procedures and on the bootstrap methodology. It aims to obtain more reliable and accurate mortality projections, based on the idea of obtaining an acceptable accuracy of the estimate by means of variance reducing techniques. In this way the forecasting procedure becomes more efficient. The longevity question constitutes a critical element in the solvency appraisal of pension annuities. The demographic models used for the cash flow distributions in a portfolio impact on the mathematical reserve and surplus calculations and affect the risk management choices for a pension plan. The paper extends the investigation of the impact of survival uncertainty for life annuity portfolios and for a guaranteed annuity option in the case where interest rates are stochastic. In a framework in which insurance companies need to use internal models for risk management purposes and for determining their solvency capital requirement, the authors consider the surplus value, calculated as the ratio between the market value of the projected assets to that of the liabilities, as a meaningful measure of the company's financial position, expressing the degree to which the liabilities are covered by the assets.},

abstract={Aim of the study was to investigate, by means of a driving simulator experiment, drivers' behaviour in terms of speed, deceleration, and lateral position on major approaches of rural intersections in relation to different perceptual cues. In the experiment, ten different design conditions with and without speed-reducing treatments along the approach to the intersection were tested. Twenty-three drivers drove a test route two times and data from the second drive were used for comparison. The order of the ten design conditions was counterbalanced for all the drivers to minimize the presentation order effect. Three different data analysis techniques were used: (a) cluster analysis of speed and lateral position data, (b) statistical tests of speed and lateral position data, and (c) categorical analysis of deceleration behaviour patterns. The most effective treatments were the dragon teeth markings (based on the principle of optical road narrowing), the colored intersection area (based on the principle of intersection highlighting), and the raised median island (based on the principle of physical road narrowing). These measures, in comparison to the base intersection, produced: (1) a significant speed reduction starting from 250 m before the intersection in the range between 13 and 23 km/h, (2) a significant change in the deceleration behaviour with a reduction in the proportion of drivers which did not decelerate, and (3) a shift away from the intersection of the deceleration beginning. Given the significant effects on drivers' behaviour, the dragon teeth markings, the colored intersection area, and the raised median island are strongly recommended for real world implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The literature on collusive cartels has mainly focused on the impact of antitrust fines on the sustainability of cartels, in infinitely repeated games. This approach, however, does not allow us to study the effect of antitrust fines on the incentives to form cartels in the first place. In this paper, we adopt a coalitional game approach to modeling collusive agreements, showing that antitrust fines may drive firms from partial cartels to a monopolistic cartel. Moreover, by introducing uncertainty on market demand, we show that the socially optimal competition policy can call for a finite or even zero antitrust penalty, even if there are no enforcement costs. We provide a sufficient condition for these results to apply to any coalitional game of cartel formation with symmetric firms. Then, we discuss the extension to asymmetric firms and dynamic collusion. Copyright © 2011 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper investigates fire sales of downgraded corporate bonds induced by regulatory constraints imposed on insurance companies. As insurance companies hold over one-third of investment-grade corporate bonds, the collective need to divest downgraded issues may be limited by a scarcity of counterparties. Using insurance company transaction data, we find that insurance companies that are relatively more constrained by regulation are more likely to sell downgraded bonds. Bonds subject to a high probability of regulatory-induced selling exhibit price declines and subsequent reversals. These price effects appear larger during periods when the insurance industry is relatively distressed and other potential buyers' carpital is scarce. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={When firms' research can lead to potentially harmful innovations, public intervention may thwart their incentives to undertake research by reducing its expected profitability (average deterrence) and may guide the use of innovation (marginal deterrence). We compare four policy regimes: laissez faire, ex-post penalties and two forms of authorization - lenient and strict. If fines are unbounded, laissez faire is optimal if the social harm from innovation is sufficiently unlikely; otherwise, regulation should impose increasing penalties as innovation becomes more dangerous. If fines are bounded by limited liability, for intermediate levels of expected social harm it is optimal to adopt (indifferently) penalties or lenient authorization, while strict authorization becomes optimal if social harm is sufficiently likely. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent empirical findings by Elsas (2005) and Degryse and Ongena (2007) document a U-shaped effect of market concentration on relationship lending which cannot be easily accommodated by the investment and strategic theories of bank lending orientation. In this paper, we suggest that this non-monotonicity can be explained by looking at the organizational structure of local credit markets. We provide evidence that marginal increases in interbank competition are detrimental to relationship lending in markets where large and out-of-market banks are predominant. By contrast, where relational lending technologies are already widely in use in the market by a large group of small mutual banks, an increase in competition may drive banks to further cultivate their extensive ties with customers. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper considers a new strategy of limiting the internal impact of downside risk of isolated entrepreneurial initiatives to achieve a specific, highly innovative project. As an alternative to the traditional spin-off, often excessive when the project is limited and isolated, a kind of 'spin-in' can be adopted by setting aside (and isolating at both an operative and accounting level) the internal resources strictly functional to the specific project. This is a solution recently introduced in Italy. The part of the firm's assets set aside from the rest of the business represents to what extent the firm is willing to expose itself to risk for the project in question. It is a kind of real option to take advantage of certain types of innovation without excessive boomerang effects. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper analyses theoretically favouritism in recruitment decisions. We study the investments in connections by applicants for jobs which pay a wage rent and the behaviour of public or private managers intending to favour the recruitment of connected agents in place of more competent candidates. Key elements in determining favouritism are the delegation of recruitment decisions and unverifiable information regarding the skills of job applicants. We show in an agency framework that if the manager is "corruptible", both low and high ability workers invest in connections and that nepotism is more widespread in jobs paying high wage-rents; in organisations in which "low-powered incentives" are used for managers; when firm performance is slightly sensitive to abilities; when it is easy to make hidden payments and the intensity of family ties is strong; when the uncertainty of connection process is low. © 2011.},

abstract={The recent development of remote sensing techniques brings new possibilities of precise ground movement measurements. One of these possibilities is the PS-InSAR™ method. It allows detecting small and long period ground deformations on large areas. In particular, the PS-InSAR technique involves interferometric phase comparison of several radar images of the same scene taken at different times along the same orbit by satellite radar sensors. The ground deformations occurring in the Campania Region has been recently investigated by applying this interferometric technique in a peculiar project developed by Italian Ministry of Environment. The outcome consists in a very large and complex database that cannot be easily analysed with traditional tools. In order to improve the interpretability of this dataset and to support the study of the geologists of this project, we apply a clustering data mining approach on a sample area and identify homogeneous clusters of ground deformation velocity trends. We report in this paper the main results of this analysis, showing how the chosen clustering method allows a coherent geological interpretation of this large and scattered dataset. © 2011 Asian Network for scientific information.},

abstract={Indirect reciprocity is generally considered one of the leading mechanisms to explain how cooperation may emerge by natural selection. The basic intuition is that establishing a reputation of being a helpful individual increases the probability of being in turn helped. Two models have been proposed to describe how indirect reciprocity may work: the standing model (Sugden 1986/2004 in The economics of rights, cooperation and welfare. Blackwell, Oxford.) and the image-scoring model (Nowak and Sigmund 1998a in Nature 393:573-577, b in J Theoretical Biol 194:561-574). Although there is evidence that the former model would perform better under a wide set of circumstances, it is often maintained that it requires individuals with an implausibly large capacity of processing recursive information. In this paper, I argue that this is not actually the case.

abstract={We introduce a core-like concept (called F-core) for games in which the worth of any coalition is given by means of a fuzzy interval. Such a class of cooperative games was introduced by Mares in 1999. Different from Mares' approach, the F-core generalizes the interval core introduced by Alparslan, Branzei and Tijs in 2008 for games where the worth of any coalition is a compact interval of the real line. Moreover, we introduce a balanced-like condition and prove that this condition is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee the F-core to be non-empty. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Using a dynamic factor model, we uncover four main empirical regularities on international comovements in a long-run panel of real and nominal variables. First, the contribution of world comovements to domestic output growth has decreased over the post-WWII period. The contribution of regional comovements, however, has increased significantly. Second, the share of inflation variation due to a global factor has become larger since 1985. Third, over most of the post-WWII period, international comovements within regions have accounted for the bulk of fluctuations in business cycle and inflation. Fourth, prices have become significantly less countercyclical during the post-1984 sample, with the largest contribution due to external developments. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={WebMining can be defined as the application of Data mining processes to Web data. In the field of Web Mining, we distinguish among Web Content Mining, Web Structure Mining and Web Usage Mining. Web Content Mining is the Web Mining process which analyze various aspects related to the contents of a web site such as text, banners, graphics etc. Web Structure Mining is the branch of Web Mining that analyze the structure of the Net (or a sub-part) in terms of connection among the web pages and their linkage design. Finally, Web Usage Mining goal is to understand the usage custom behaviors of web sites users. Within the context of Web Usage Mining, pattern discovery and pattern analysis allow to profile users and their preferences. The sequence rules are association rules ordered in time. Given a data set coming from a web site which is characterized by a sequence of visits, the proposal is to understand the differences among browsing sections through a Multidimensional Scaling solution, and then obtain a graphical tool which allows to visualize in a new way the sequence rules. The resulting application is half way between Web Usage Mining and Web Structure Mining. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the impact of the degree of school competition on the achievement of Italian students. Specifically, competition is measured as the number of schools available to students in a given area. The aim is to evaluate whether an increase in school choice improves the quality of education. Using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA, 2006) dataset we investigate with simple Least Squares regression models, controlling for a host of individual and school characteristics, if secondary school students with a wider range of schools choices perform better than those students whose choice is more limited. We find a significant positive correlation between students' performance and the degree of local schools competition. Moreover, we show that students achieve much better outcomes if schools operating in more competitive environments also experience a higher pressure on academic standards coming from parents.

The Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth records detailed portfolio data and elicits expectations of retirement outcomes, thus allowing us to measure expected social security wealth and assess to what extent Italian households perceive the innovations brought about by the reforms. We find that households have responded to cuts in pension benefits mostly by increasing real estate wealth, and that this response is stronger among households able more accurately to estimate future social security benefits. We also compute that for the average household consumable wealth increases by 40 percent of the reduction in social security wealth. © Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract={This paper shows that a regression tree problem can be turned into a classification tree problem reducing the computational cost and providing useful interpretation issues. A TWO-CLASS tree methodoloy for non-parametric regression analysis is introduced. Data are as follows: a numerical response variable and a set of predictors (of categorical and/or numerical type) are measured on a sample of objects, with no probability assumption. Thus a non-parametric approach is proposed. The concepts of prospective and retrospective splits are considered. Main idea is to grow a binary partition of the sample of objects such that, at each node of the tree structure, the numerical response is recoded into a dummy or two-class variable (called theoretical response) on the basis of the optimal partition of the objects into two groups within the set of retrospective splits. A two-stage splitting criterion with a fast algorithm is applied: the best split of the objects is found in the set of candidate (prospective) splits of each predictor modalities by maximizing the predictability of the two-class response. Some applications on real world cases and a simulation study allow to demonstrate that the two-class splitting procedure is computationally less intensive than standard regression tree such as CART. Furthermore, the final partitions obtained by the two-class procedure and the standard one are very similar to each other, in terms of percentage of objects belonging together to the same terminal node. Some aids to the interpretation allow to describe the response variable distribution in the terminal nodes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={This article analyzes employer labor tax evasion and the impact on this evasion of tax inspections by a labor inspectorate. The analysis is based on a unique data set built by linking two sources of information: a data set of individual artisan firms and an individual audit data set. Our data describe the universe of artisan firms in Piedmont (Italy) in 2000 to 2005. Using information on firm characteristics and tax evasion observed directly from the audit exercise, we estimate undeclared work in the artisan sector, and we then evaluate the impact of tax inspections on employer labor tax declarations. We find that inspections could actually be counterproductive, decreasing both tax compliance and tax revenues. © The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract={The paper investigates the financial dynamics of the surplus evolution in the case of deferred life schemes, in order to evaluate both the distributable earnings and the expected worst occurence for the portfolio surplus. The evaluation is based on a compact formulation of the insurance surplus defined as the difference between accrued assets and present value of relevant liabilities. The dynamic analysis is performed by means of Monte Carlo simulations in order to provide a year-by-year valuation. The analysis is applied to a deferred life scheme exemplar, considering that the selected contract constitutes the basis for many life insurance policies and pension plans. The evaluation is put into an asset and liability management decision-making context, where the relationships between profits and risks are compared in order to evaluate the main features of the whole portfolio.},

abstract={We study relations among Walrasian expectations allocations,coalitional fair allocations and the private core of economies with uncertainty and asymmetric information. Our analysis covers finite exchange models, as well as models of mixed markets consisting of some large traders and an ocean of small traders. The adopted notion of coalitional fairness requires that: 1. Under a "c-fair" allocation, no coalition could benefit from achieving the net trade of some other disjoint coalition; 2. Coalition bargaining takes place without information sharing among agents. We introduce a notion of restricted Walrasian expectations allocation and examine its relations with c-fairness. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.},

abstract={In this paper we study the relevance of the gender of the contracting parties involved in lending. We show that female entrepreneurs face tighter credit availability, even though they do not pay higher interest rates. The effect is independent of the information available about the borrower and holds if we control for unobservable individual effects. The gender of the loan officer is also important: we find that female officers are more risk-averse or less self-confident than male officers as they tend to restrict credit availability to new, un-established borrowers more than their male counterparts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Entrepreneurs may be legally bound to bequeath a minimal stake to noncontrolling heirs. The size of this stake can reduce investment in family firms, by reducing the future income they can pledge to external financiers. Using a purpose-built indicator of the permissiveness of inheritance law and data for 10,004 firms from 38 countries in 1990-2006, we find that stricter inheritance law is associated with lower investment in family firms but does not affect investment in nonfamily firms. Moreover, as the model predicts, inheritance law affects investment only in family frms that experience a succession.},

abstract={We review different empirical approaches that researchers have taken to estimate how consumption responds to income changes. We critically evaluate the empirical evidence on the sensitivity of consumption to predicted income changes, distinguishing between the traditional excess sensitivity tests and the effect of predicted income increases and income declines. We also review studies that attempt to estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of income shocks, distinguishing between three different approaches: identifying episodes in which income changes unexpectedly, relying on the covariance restrictions that the theory imposes on the joint behavior of consumption and income growth, and combining realizations and expectations of income or consumption in surveys in which data on subjective expectations are available.

abstract={A growing body of research is focusing on banking organizational issues, emphasizing the difficulties encountered by the hierarchically organized banks in lending informationally opaque borrowers. While the two extreme cases of hierarchical and non-hierarchical organizations are typically contrasted, what shapes the degree of hierarchy and how to measure it remain fairly vague. In this article, we compare bank size and functional distance between bank branches and headquarters as possible sources of organizational friction studying their impact on the likelihood of small firms introducing innovations. Our results show that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) located in provinces where the local banking system is functionally distant are less inclined to introduce process and product innovations, while the market share of large banks is only slightly correlated with firms' propensity to introduce new products. © The Author (2009).

abstract={This article uses international panel data on 55 countries from 1995 to 2008, merging indicators of economic literacy with a large set of macroeconomic and institutional variables. Results show that there is substantial heterogeneity of financial and economic competence across countries, and that human capital indicators (PISA test scores and college attendance) are positively correlated with economic literacy. Furthermore, inhabitants of countries with more generous social security systems are generally less literate, lending support to the hypothesis that the incentives to acquire economic literacy are related to the amount of resources available for private accumulation. © 2010 TheAuthor(s).

abstract={The paper investigated drivers' speed behaviour in a section of a rural highway crossing a small urban community in the existing scenario without any traffic calming device and in two different design scenarios with traffic calming in the urban community. Two gateways and four integrative traffic calming devices along the route within the urban area were tested. The gateways were aimed at slowing down the vehicles entering in the built-up area, while the traffic calming devices were aimed at complementing the gateway effect inside the built-up area. Two design options were tested: first option (alt1) is a combination of low cost measures, whereas the second option (alt2) is more expensive as includes a chicane and requires land acquisition. Drivers' behaviour was investigated by means of a driving simulator experiment. The VERA dynamic-driving simulator operating at the TEST Road Safety Laboratory located in Naples (Italy) was used. Simulation results were validated by the comparison of speed behaviour in the real world and in the driving simulator, in the scenario without traffic calming. Analysis of the driving simulator experiment results was performed using two different approaches: (a) explorative description of data by cluster analysis; (b) inferential procedures about population using statistical tests. Cluster analysis was carried out in order to test if the drivers' speed behaviour in the different design alternatives was substantially different. Statistical tests were performed in order to verify if speeds in specific sections were significantly different. Cluster analysis looked at speed profiles, whereas statistical tests looked at speed data in specific points. The obtained results showed a different behaviour of drivers approaching the urban community in the existing scenario and in the design scenarios. In the south direction, mean speed reduction ranging between 16 and 17 km/h, with 5% level of significance, was observed. In the north direction, mean speed reduction equal to 11 km/h, with 10% level of significance, was observed. Differences between the two design alternatives were not statistically significant. Along the urban community, a statistically significant mean speed reduction ranging between 9 and 15 km/h was observed in the south direction. In the north direction, speed reduction was not statistically significant. Overall, combined results of cluster analysis and statistical tests showed that the treatments were more effective in the direction with higher speeds in the base scenario. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Under the Bayesian-Walrasian Equilibrium (BWE) (see Balder and Yannelis, 2009), agents form price estimates based on their own private information, and in terms of those prices they can formulate estimated budget sets. Then, based on his/her own private information, each agent maximizes interim expected utility subject to his/her own estimated budget set. From the imprecision due to the price estimation it follows that the resulting equilibrium allocation may not clear the markets for every state of nature, i.e., exact feasibility of allocations may not occur. This paper shows that if the economy is repeated from period to period and agents refine their private information by observing the past BWE, then in the limit all agents will obtain the same information and market clearing will be reached. The converse is also true. The analysis provides a new way of looking at the asymmetric equilibrium which has a statistical foundation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Stricter laws require more incisive and costlier enforcement. Because enforcement activity depends both on available tax revenue and the honesty of officials, the optimal legal standard of a benevolent government is increasing in per capita income and decreasing in officials' corruption. In contrast to the "toll booth view" of regulation, the standard chosen by aself-interested government is a non-monotonic function of officials' corruption, and can be either lower or higher than that chosen by a benevolent regulator. International evidence on environmental regulation shows that standards correlate positively with per-capita income, and negatively with corruption, consistent with the model's predictions for benevolent governments. © 2010 by the European Economic Association.},

Morgan, On convergence results for weak efficiency in vector optimization problems with equilibrium constraints, J. Optim. Theor. Appl. 133 (2007), pp. 117-121] and in line with the results obtained in optimization, game theory and scalar variational inequalities, our aim is to investigate lower convergence properties (in the sense of Painleve-Kuratowski) for such approximate solution sets in the presence of perturbations on the data. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the lower convergence of 'strict approximate' solution sets but counter-examples show that, in general, the other types of solutions do not lower converge. Moreover, we prove that any exact solution to the limit problem can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of approximate solutions to the perturbed problems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Multicriteria games describe strategic interactions in which players, having more than one criterion to take into account, don't have an a-priori opinion on the relative importance of all these criteria. Roemer (Econ. Bull. 3:1-13, 2005) introduces an organizational interpretation of the concept of equilibrium: each player can be viewed as running a bargaining game among criteria. In this paper, we analyze the bargaining problem within each player by considering the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (see Kalai and Smorodinsky in Econometrica 43:513-518, 1975). We provide existence results for the so called Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution equilibria for a general class of disagreement points which properly includes the one considered by Roemer (Econ. Bull. 3:1-13, 2005). Moreover we look at the refinement power of this equilibrium concept and show that it is an effective selection device even when combined with classical refinement concepts based on stability with respect to perturbations; in particular, we consider the extension to multicriteria games of the Selten's trembling hand perfect equilibrium concept (see Selten in Int. J. Game Theory 4:25-55, 1975) and prove that perfect Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution equilibria exist and properly refine both the perfect equilibria and the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution equilibria. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={This paper examines the role of credit rating agencies in the subprime crisis that triggered the 2007-2008 financial turmoil. We focus on two aspects of ratings that contributed to the boom and bust of the market for structured debt: rating inflation and coarse information disclosure. The paper discusses how regulation can be designed to mitigate these problems in the future. Our preferred policy is to require rating agencies to be paid by investors rather than by issuers and to grant open and free access to data about the loans or securities underlying structured debt products. A more modest (but less effective) approach would be to retain the 'issuer pays' model but require issuers to pay an upfront fee irrespective of the rating, ban 'credit shopping', and prescribe a more complete format for the information that rating agencies must disseminate. -Marco Pagano and Paolo Volpin. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2010.},

abstract={The paper explores the determinants of yield differentials between sovereign bonds, using euro-area data. There is a common trend in yield differentials, which is correlated with a measure of aggregate risk. In contrast, liquidity differentials display sizeable heterogeneity and no common factor. We propose a simple model with endogenous liquidity demand, where a bonds liquidity premium depends both on its transaction cost and on investment opportunities. The model predicts that yield differentials should increase in both liquidity and risk, with an interaction term of the opposite sign. Testing these predictions on daily data, we find that the aggregate risk factor is consistently priced, liquidity differentials are priced for a subset of countries, and their interaction with the risk factor is in line with the models prediction and crucial to detect their effect.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to investigate, by means of a dynamic driving simulator experiment, the behavior of road users at rural intersections in relation to perceptual measures designed for increasing hazard detection. In the experiment 10 configurations of tangents were tested: Alt1, base tangent; Alt2, four-leg base intersection; Alt3, intersection with reduced sight distance; and Alt4 through Alt10, intersections with perceptual treatments. The Virtual Environment for Road Safety high-fidelity dynamic-driving simulator, operating at the Technology Environment Safety Transport Road Safety Laboratory located in Naples, Italy, was used. Analysis of the results used two approaches: (a) explorative description of data by cluster analysis and (b) inferential procedures about population using statistical tests. Results showed that the speed behavior in the tangents was significantly affected by the presence of the intersections and by the perceptual treatments. Intersections without perceptual treatments significantly affected driver speeds in the 250 m preceding the intersection. Perceptual treatments helped the driver to detect the intersection earlier and to slow down. Dragon teeth markings, colored intersection area, and raised median island performed better than the other perceptual treatments. They produced significant average speed reduction in the 150 m preceding the intersection ranging between 16 km/h and 23 km/h. Study results support real-world implementation of perceptual measures in rural intersections because they are low-cost, fast implementation measures with a high potential to be cost-effective.},

abstract={We study the relation between cognitive abilities and stockholding using the recent Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which has detailed data on wealth and portfolio composition of individuals aged 50+ in 11 European countries and three indicators of cognitive abilities: mathematical, verbal fluency, and recall skills. We find that the propensity to invest in stocks is strongly associated with cognitive abilities, for both direct stock market participation and indirect participation through mutual funds and retirement accounts. Since the decision to invest in less information-intensive assets (such as bonds) is less strongly related to cognitive abilities, we conclude that the association between cognitive abilities and stockholding is driven by information constraints, rather than by features of preferences or psychological traits. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We explore the pattern of elderly homeownership using 60 microeconomic surveys on about 300,000 individuals residing in 15 OECD countries. In all countries, the survey is repeated over time, permitting construction of an international dataset of repeated cross-sectional data. We find that ownership rates decline considerably after age 60. However, a large part of the decline depends on cohort effects. Adjusting for them, we find that ownership rates start falling after age 70 and reach a percentage point per year decline after age 75. We find that differences across country ownership trajectories are correlated with indicators measuring market regulation degree. © Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract={This paper presents stylized facts on labor supply, income, consumption, wealth, and several measures of consumption and income inequality drawn from the 1980-2006 Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) conducted by the Bank of Italy. The SHIW provides information on consumption, income and wealth, and a sizable panel component that allows econometricians to estimate sophisticated income, consumption, and wealth processes and to analyze labor market and portfolio transitions. We find that over the sample period income inequality is higher and has grown faster than consumption inequality. Most of the increase in income inequality is related to an increase in the degree of earnings' instability rather than to shifts in the wage structure. We suggest that, in particular, the labor market reforms of the 1990s and 2000s are the most plausible explanation of the increased earnings inequality. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We also investigate on weaker equivalences among Walrasian expectations allocations, Aubin private core and private core allocations of the original mixed economy and the atomless one associated to it, without the assumption that all atoms are of the same type. Furthermore, extensions of Hervés-Moreno-Yannelis and Schmeidler Theorems (compare Hervés et al. in J Math Econ 41:844-856, 2005a; Schemidler in Econometrica 40:579-580, 1972) are given for differential information economies in which the feasibility constraints are imposed with an equality (exact feasibility). © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A large body of literature considers the advantages of using informal networks to match workers to jobs. However, family ties may interfere with a genuine process of worker selection, favoring people with connections over more talented workers. We offer a simple model of favoritism to explain these risks and show firms' trade-off in using informal channels. We then investigate empirically the determinants and consequences of using informal networks in Italy by using the Bank of Italy Survey. We find that informal networks tend to be used by low-educated individuals, in small firms, in low-productivity jobs and in less developed regions. Finally, we show that informal networks have a negative impact on wages, controlling for individual and firm characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This means that given a game y, a net (yα)α of games converging to y and a net (xα)α such that xα is a Nash equilibrium of any yα, then at least a cluster point of (xα)α is a Nash equilibrium of y. In order to obtain this property, we prove that the map of Nash equilibria is upper semicontinuous. Using the pseudocontinuity, a generalization of the continuity, we improve previous results obtained with continuous functions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A threat for vaccination policies might be the onset of "rational" exemption, i.e. the family's decision not to vaccinate children after a seemingly rational comparison between the perceived risk of infection and the perceived risk of vaccine side effects. We study the implications of rational exemption by models of vaccination choice. By a simple model of individual choice we first prove the "elimination impossible" result in presence of informed families, i.e. aware of herd immunity, and suggest that limited information might explain patterns of universal vaccination. Next, we investigate vaccination choice in a game-theoretic framework for communities stratified into two groups, "pro" and "anti" vaccinators, having widely different perceived costs of infection and of vaccine side effects. We show that under informed families neither a Nash nor a Stackelberg behaviour (characterized, respectively, by players acting simultaneously and by an asymmetric situation with a "leader" and a "follower) allow elimination, unless "pro-vaccinators" assign no costs to vaccine side effects. Elimination turns out to be possible when cooperation is encouraged by a social planner, provided, however, he incorporates in the "social loss function" the preferences of anti-vaccinators only. This allows an interpretation of the current Italian vaccination policy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Given their importance in determining the outcome of many economic interactions, different models have been proposed to determine how social networks form and which structures are stable. In Bala and Goyal (Econometrica 68, 1181-1229, 2000), the one-sided link formation model has been considered, which is based on a noncooperative game of network formation. They found that the empty networks, the wheel in the one-way flow of benefits case and the center-sponsored star in the two-way flow case play a fundamental role since they are strict Nash equilibria of the corresponding games for a certain class of payoff functions. In this paper, we first prove that all these network structures are in weakly dominated strategies whenever there are no strict Nash equilibria. Then, we exhibit a more accurate selection device between these network architectures by considering "altruistic behavior" refinements. Such refinements that we investigate here in the framework of finite strategy sets games have been introduced by the authors in previous papers. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.},

abstract={The empirical literature is largely supportive of the importance of financial constraints and identifies local banking development and relationship lending as possible determinants of firms' propensity to innovate. In this chapter, we argue that the spatial organization of banking systems and the distance of local branches from banks' decisional centers are major factors influencing the effectiveness in collecting and processing soft information on local innovative firms. We provide evidence showing that, while branch density and the length of credit relationships have a positive causal effect on innovation when considered singularly, after controlling for the functional distance between the banking system and the local economy they lose statistical significance in favor of the latter. In this perspective, our results suggest that the geographical organization of banks and the spatial distribution of their headquarters represent key variables for local development. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.},

abstract={In this paper, we provide first evidence of the impact of public and private expenditures in health and education on economic growth, via their influence on people's health, skills and knowledge. We consider a growth accounting framework in order to test whether countries that devote a larger amount of resources to the consumption of health and educational services experience higher growth rates. We also test whether the effects on economic growth of public expenditure in health and education differ from those of private expenditure. Our empirical analysis is based on a panel of 19 OECD countries observed between 1971 and 1998. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that health and education expenditure affects positively growth. The estimated impact is stronger for health than for education. More importantly, we find some evidence that public expenditure influences GDP growth more than private expenditure. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Two contrasting trends have emerged from the intense integration and consolidation process that have swept the European and U.S. banking industry in the 1990s: the geographical diffusion of banking structures and instruments and the geographical concentration of banking power in a few financial centers within each country. The first trend has contributed to greatly reduce the operational distance that separates banks from their clientele. The second has increased the functional distance that separates the bank's decision center from its operational branches. The conflicting movements in operational and functional distances have left a mark on market structure, financial integration and regulation of the banking industry, and have induced a transformation in organizational structures, lending behavior and relationships between banks and firms. This book, not only surveys the great research effort that has been made recently on the geography of banking and finance, but also provides new insights and empirical vidence on how the geography of banking and finance has evolved and impacted its customers. This is a timely and valuable volume that collects up-to-date empirical research on the geography of the banking industry and financial centers. Allen N. Berger H. Montague Osteen, Jr. Professor in Banking and Finance Moore School of Business University of South Carolina, USA The geography of banking has changed dramatically in recent years, under the combined effect of new information technology, deregulation and international integration. This book assesses thoroughly what we know and what we don't know yet about this process and about its effects on the provision of credit to households and firms (especially small and medium ones). It is going to be a valuable reference on the evolution of the banking industry for years to come. Marco Pagano Professor of Economics University of Naples Federico II, Italy The subdiscipline concerned with the geography of banking is a relatively new one, and the research frontier is s ill largely unexplored. This book makes a timely and valuable contribution to opening up this territory; providing intriguing insight into how new information technologies, financial innovation, de- and re-regulation, and globalisation processes more generally, are reshaping not only the geographies of banking itself, but also the spatialities of credit provision, financial flows and monetary circulation. An essential read for financial economists, economic geographers and all those interested in the world of finance.

abstract={In this chapter we analyse the new geography of the Italian banking system on the basis of the integration pressures of recent years. The analysis of the evolution of the banking system is focused on the concept of distance. In particular, we not only refer to the traditional distance between bank and customers, that is the operational distance, but also to the distance between decision centres of banks and local systems, that we define as functional distance. The focus of the chapter is on the effect that functional distance (or proximity) has on the performance of banks in terms of credit allocation, efficiency, and profitability. Our regression analysis proves that functional proximity has asymmetric territorial effects on the banks performance. Its beneficial effects are more evident in the less developed southern regions, than in the more advanced Centre-North regions of Italy. © Physica-Verlag Heidelberg 2009.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the relatively novel concept of a downward-sloping demand for volunteer labour, using data from the Italian social services sector. Both descriptive and econometric evidence shows that the price of volunteer labour (proxied by its shadow price obtained through DEA) is negatively related to the number of volunteer hours. Furthermore, the demand for volunteer labour is higher in areas relatively well endowed with social capital, where there is also evidence that organizations refrain from substituting volunteers for paid workers when the latter become more expensive. According to our results, the productivity of voluntary labour is higher in social capital-rich regions, where more motivated and skilful volunteers are drawn from a relatively larger pool. © 2009 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.},

It looks at how cross-country comparisons of income, wealth and debt are affected by differences in purchasing power, household size and taxation, and shows that some seemingly wide international differences appear less so when the proper adjustments are made. The article reveals wide differences in income, wealth and indebtedness of elderly households in Europe, and provides background information on social issues such as the adequacy of savings at retirement, and the financial fragility of the elderly. © The Author(s), 2009.},

abstract={In the early 1990s, a widely shared opinion among scholars and practitioners was that the importance of physical proximity between banks and borrowers would be doomed to decrease drastically over time and, put in extreme terms, the end of banking geography would become a real possibility. However, the empirical evidence shows the continued importance of local credit markets for small borrowers and local economic development. In this paper, we selectively review the literature on the real effects of bank consolidation and produce new evidence on the role of headquarter-to-branch functional distance on relationship lending. © The Author 2009.

abstract={Consider a Cournot oligopoly where producers launch new products. At first potential buyers are unaware of the product, and firms decide on levels of production, advertising expenditure and a cost-reducing investment. We find the conditions for complementarities among scale, advertising and innovation strategies to arise. In a duopoly with substitute products all variables are higher for the firm that moves from mass advertising to targeted advertising but decrease for the other. In an oligopoly with complementary products all variables are higher for all firms when they shift away from mass marketing. We conclude by linking our results to the empirical literature on internalization which finds a positive relationship between advertising intensity and foreign direct investment. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.},

abstract={Bank deregulation and progress in information technology altered the geographical diffusion of banking structures and instruments, and reduced operational distance between banks and local economies. However, the consolidation of the banking industry promoted the geographical concentration of banking decision-making centres and increased functional distance between local banking systems and local borrowers. This paper focuses on the impact that these spatial diffusionconcentration phenomena had on the financing constraints of Italian firms over the period 1996?2003. Our findings show that greater functional distance stiffened financing constraints, especially for small firms, while smaller operational distance did not always enhance credit availability.},

abstract={We investigate whether information sharing among banks has affected credit market performance in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, using a large sample of firm-level data. Our estimates show that information sharing is associated with improved availability and lower cost of credit to firms. This correlation is stronger for opaque firms than transparent ones and stronger in countries with weak legal environments than in those with strong legal environments. In cross-sectional estimates, we control for variation in country-level aggregate variables that may affect credit, by examining the differential impact of information sharing across firm types. In panel estimates, we also control for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity at the firm level, as well as for changes in macroeconomic variables and the legal environment. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Despite of this, we show that in every replica economy a private core allocation, which treats agents of the same type equally, exists.

abstract={We provide an evaluation of the measure of privately blocking coalitions in differential information economies. In the case of atomless economies, it is proved that for a Pareto optimal allocation that is not a Walrasian expectations equilibrium, to any symmetric profile there corresponds a ball such that "almost half" of the profiles it contains are privately blocking. Analogous results are proved in the case of finite differential information economies for generalized coalitions and social coalition structures. From a different point of view, the paper can be considered as a contribution showing private core equivalence theorems under restrictions on coalition formation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The portfolio consistency fund studied in the paper is referred to a pension scheme of beneficiaries entering in the retirement state at the same time. It arises from the payment stream consisting in cash flows due at the beginning of each year in case of life of the pensioner: in the deferment period, in the form of premiums entering in the fund, and during the retirement period, in the form of instalments getting out of it. The fund dynamic as function of the time of valuation evolves increasing thanks to the interest maturing on the accumulated fund and decreasing because of the benefits paid to the survivals. Both the mortality trend, determining the number of payments at each time, and the interest maturing on the fund, are considered deterministically unknown at the moment of the contract issue. Stochastic assumptions about the behaviour of the interest rate process and the description of the mortality trend betterment, most likely to be expected in very long periods and in civilized world, provide a dynamic description of the pension scheme and in particular of the pension fund. In the paper we want to deepen the aspect of the financial and demographic basis chosen for premium calculation with respect to the impact on the portfolio fund consistency and on the risk arising from the randomness in the choice of the survival model used for the valuations. To this aim, we will assume for the fund description different projection levels for the survival probabilities and the Vasicek hypotheses for the interest rates maturing on the fund itself; moreover, we will determine the premium amounts introducing different scenarios in a safety loading perspective. As evident, in the premium quantification lower interest rate jointly with higher survival probabilities constitute a form of implied loading. The numerical application presented in the paper shows how the change in the premium calculation conditions affects the portfolio fund consistency in the different scenarios and investigates on the impact they have on the Demographic Model Risk Measure. Useful information for managing aim can be derived. © 2009 IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce two new definitions of pair-wise and multi-wise similarity between short-run dynamics of inflation rates in terms of equality of forecast functions and show that in the context of invertible ARIMA processes the autoregressive metric introduced by Piccolo (1990) is a useful measure to evaluate such similarity. Then, we study the similarity of short-run inflation dynamics across European Union (EU)-25 Member States during the Euro period. Consistent with studies on inflation differentials and inflation persistence, our findings suggest that after seven years from the launch of the Euro the degree of similarity of short-run inflation dynamics across Euro area countries is still weak. By contrast, we find that EU countries not adopting the common currency, whether old EU or new accession Members, display a higher degree of inflation dynamics similarity both among each other and with Euro area countries. © Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract={Recent models with liquidity constraints and impatience emphasize that consumers use savings to buffer income fluctuations. When wealth is belowan optimal target, consumers try to increase their buffer stock of wealth by saving more. When it is above target, they increase consumption. This important implication of the buffer stock model of saving has not been subject to direct empirical testing. We derive from the model an appropriate theoretical restriction and test it using data on working-age individuals drawn from the 2002 and 2004 Italian Surveys of Household Income and Wealth. One of the most appealing features of the survey is that it has data on the amount of wealth held for precautionary purposes, which we interpret as target wealth in a buffer stock model. The test results do not support buffer stock behavior, even among population groups that are more likely, a priori, to display such behavior. The saving behavior of young households is instead consistent with models in which impatience, relative to prudence, is not as high as in buffer stock models. © 2008 by the European Economic Association.},

abstract={In a framework à la Martin (1993) we introduce a common component in the managers' private information in order to address three related questions: What is the impact of contracts that reward managers on the basis of realized profits on firms' productive and allocative efficiency relative to cost-target contracts? How do these contracts shape the relationship between competition and organizational slack? Can we then explain the existing evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between competition and cost-reducing activities, as documented in Aghion et al. [Aghion, P., Bloom, N., Blundell, R., Griffith, R., Howitt, P., "Competition and innovation: an inverted-U Relationship", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120: pp. 701-728, 2005]? We show that profit-target contracts introduce a horizontal (contractual) externality between the competing firms that mitigates organizational slack and improves upon productive efficiency relative to cost-plus mechanisms. Moreover, when executive compensations are conditioned on profits, an inverted-U shaped relationship between product market competition and managerial effort obtains. Finally, we also show that when contractual instruments are endogenous, i.e., when shareholders can choose between profit- and cost-target rules, the equilibrium with profit-target contracts always exists and is the only one that survives to standard refinements. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A dynamic factor model is used to investigate on the variability in labor productivity and hours across the 2-digit US manufacturing industries. Two kind of shocks emerge as quantitatively relevant during the postwar period. They can be reasonably interpreted as technology shocks to the production of equipment and economy-wide shocks. The former induces a positive correlation between productivity and hours growth rates in the durable-goods producing sector; the latter spurs a negative correlation in the nondurable-goods producing sector. Such evidence provides a novel interpretation of the aggregate near-zero correlation between the two variables. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study analyzes the determinants of individual subjective well-being (happiness) in Italy by estimating microeconometric happiness equations in order to examine the effects of socio-demographic characteristics and economic conditions on subjective evaluations of happiness. Consistent with the findings in other advanced countries we find that income and wealth increase happiness and that unemployment is extremely bad for subjective well-being. In addition, we obtain some novel and interesting results for Italy including the following: income obtained by public transfers has a limited impact on subjective well-being; education increases happiness, even when controlling for income; Southern residents and individuals living in large cities are less happy; and social capital makes people happier. Finally, individuals care about relative income, in the sense that their happiness is negatively influenced by the income of others in their group of reference. Our results show that several non-economic variables are extremely important for subjective well-being. Copyright 2008 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we analyse the nature of the relationship between market power and technical efficiency for producers' cooperatives. More specifically we test two hypotheses: first, we evaluate the extent to which increasing market pressure may help producers' cooperatives to improve technical efficiency to guarantee positive profits; second, we test whether higher technical efficiency induces producers' cooperatives to have a larger market share. These hypotheses are tested on a sample of Italian conventional and cooperative firms for the Wine Production and Processing sector, using both frontier analysis and dynamic panel techniques. The results support the hypothesis that increasing market pressure can affect positively the cooperativeś efficiency, while gains in technical efficiency do not seem to have any impact on the cooperatives' market share. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The impact on vertical contracting of a type-dependent reservation utility is investigated within a sequential monopolies environment with asymmetric information. The welfare and private properties of contracts controlling both the retail price and the sales level are compared with those restricting only sales. When firms choose contracts non-cooperatively, retail price restrictions are desirable for the upstream supplier although detrimental to consumers, whenever the retailer reservation utility has a relevant impact on optimal contracts. If this impact is relatively weak and contracts are chosen cooperatively, vertical price control fails to maximize firms' joint-profit although it would be beneficial to consumers. © 2008 The Authors.

abstract={One of the most lively-debated effects of banking acquisitions is the change in lending and asset allocation of the target bank in favour of transaction-based products, at the expense of small and informationally opaque borrowers. These changes may be the result of two distinct restructuring strategies pursued by the acquirer with respect to the asset portfolio of the acquired bank: a cleaning strategy (CS), in which the acquirer makes a clean sweep of all the negative net present value activities in the portfolio of the acquired bank, and a portfolio strategy (PS), in which the acquiring bank permanently changes the portfolio allocation of the acquired bank. In this paper we focus on Italian bank acquisitions and test which asset restructuring strategy was predominantly pursued over the period 1997-2003. Moreover, we distinguish acquisitions according to their geographic diversifying character and to the physical and cultural distances that separate acquiring from acquired banks. When we look at the mean value, we do not find clear evidence of a primacy either of CSs or PSs. When we separate in-market from out-of-market bank acquisitions, however, results show that the CSs prevail only in the former type of deals, while in the latter the portfolio of acquired banks is subject to PSs. Finally, we find that differences in asset restructuring strategies can be explained by differences in corporate culture and the workplace environment of the dealing partners. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We introduce a refinement concept for Nash equilibria (slightly altruistic equilibrium) defined by a limit process and which captures the idea of reciprocal altruism as presented in Binmore (Proceedings of the XV Italian Meeting on Game Theory and Applications, [2003]). Existence is guaranteed for every finite game and for a large class of games with a continuum of strategies. Results and examples emphasize the (lack of) connections with classical refinement concepts. Finally, it is shown that, under a pseudomonotonicity assumption on a particular operator associated to the game, it is possible, by selecting slightly altruistic equilibria, to eliminate those equilibria in which a player can switch to a strategy that is better for the others without leaving the set of equilibria. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={We analyze the location of stock trading for firms with a US cross-listing. The fraction of trading that occurs in the United States tends to be larger for companies from countries that are geographically close to the United States and feature low financial development and poor insider trading protection. For companies based in developed countries, trading volume in the United States is larger if the company is small, volatile, and technology-oriented, while this does not apply to emerging country firms. The domestic turnover rate increases in the cross-listing year and remains higher for firms based in developed markets, but not for emerging market firms. Domestic trading volume actually declines for companies from countries with poor enforcement of insider trading regulation.},

abstract={A concept of altruistic behavior (called friendly behavior) has been defined and used for equilibrium selection in some bargaining models in Rusinowska (2002), "Refinements of Nash Equilibria in view of Jealous and Friendly Behavior of Players", International Game Theory Review, 4, 281-299. In this paper, the situation in which every player has friendly behavior is incorporated into the general context of normal form games by introducing a new refinement concept (called friendliness equilibrium). Existence, properties and connections with another refinement concept, introduced by the authors in a previous paper and which captures an idea of reciprocal altruism, are investigated. Examples and counterexamples are given illustrating concepts, results and links with other classical refinement concepts. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

For each shock, we examine the dynamic effects on the labor market, the importance of the shock for labor market volatility, and the comovement between labor market variables and other key aggregate variables in response to the shock. We document that labor market indicators display "hump-shaped" responses to the identified shocks. Technology shocks and monetary policy shocks are important for labor market volatility but the ranking of their importance is sensitive to the VAR specification. The conditional correlations at business cycle frequencies are similar in response to the four shocks, apart from the correlations between hours worked, labor productivity and real wages. To account for the unconditional correlations between these variables, a mixture of shocks is required. © The editors of the Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2008.},

In a world where some consumers are not self-interested, the price of a product made by a multinational enterprise and the latter's location and production decisions depend on the difference in labour standards between developed and less developed countries. We study the effect of an increase in the fraction of informed inequity-averse consumers on the behaviour of multinational frms, on the equilibrium level of labour standards and on the welfare of workers in the less developed countries. An increase in activism deteriorates labour practices and decreases welfare. © 2008 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The study focuses on the quantitative risk analysis of a pension scheme referred to a portfolio of beneficiaries entering in the retirement state at the same time. The analysis starts from the retirement time of the contractors and concerns the dynamic behavior of the financial periodic portfolio fund cut down year by year by the payments due to the survivals. The fund arises from the payment stream consisting in constant payments due at the beginning of each year in case of life of the pensioner in the deferment period. It gushes that the two forces operating in opposite directions from the retirement age on, in and out of the portfolio, are the increasing effect due to the interest maturing on the accumulated fund and in the outflow represented by the benefit payments due to the survival. The two processes are compared in a scenario in which the financial risk and the demographic risk are considered. Posing the time of valuation coinciding with the contract entry time, we consider deterministically unknown the dynamic of the future behavior of both the interest rates maturing on the fund and of the mortality. The mortality trend betterment in very long periods, as in the pension cases happens, leads to the need of a careful consideration of the systematic deviations of the number of deaths from the expected values. As known, if the risk arising from the accidental deviations of mortality can be hedged by pooling strategies, such that it is possible to neglect this risk source in the case of sufficiently large portfolios, the risk arising from the longevity phenomenon cannot be avoided without making dangerous mistakes consisting in underestimation of future obligations. The scenario in which the study is framed consists in stochastic hypotheses on the evolution in time of the interest rates of return on investment of the fund and in a more complex description of the mortality trend. The aim of the paper is, in particular, to study the effects of the change in the mortality description on the fund portfolio values. The survival forecasting made at the time of the contract issue, even if considered with a certain degree of projection, isn't likely to be the same we can forecast, for example, at the time of the retirement age. The choice of the "'right"' mortality table means the choice of the "'right"' projection level to attribute to the mortality trend. Risk filters and opportune indexes are considered and illustrated. © Mariarosaria Coppola, Valeria D'Amato, Emilia Di Lorenzo, Marilena Sibillo, 2008.},

abstract={The framework of this paper is classification and regression trees, also known as tree-based methods, binary segmentation, tree partitioning, decision trees. Trees can be fruitfully used either to explore and understand the dependence relationship between the response variable and a set of predictors or to assign the response class or value for new objects on which only the measurements of predictors are known. Since the introduction of two-stage splitting procedure in 1992, the research unit in Naples has been introducing several contributions in this field, one of the main issues is combining tree partitioning with statistical models. This paper will provide a new idea of knowledge extraction using trees and models. It will deal with the trade off between the interpretability of the tree structure (i.e., exploratory trees) and the accuracy of the decision tree model (i.e., decision tree-based rules). Prospective and retrospective view of using models and trees will be discussed. In particular, we will introduce a tree-based methodology that grows an optimal tree structure with the posterior prediction modelling to be used as decision rule for new objects. The general methodology will be presented and a special case will be described in details. An application on a real world data set will be finally shown.},

abstract={The framework of this paper is supervised learning using classification trees. Two types of variables play a role in the definition of the classification rule, namely a response variable and a set of predictors. The tree classifier is built up by a recursive partitioning of the prediction space such to provide internally homogeneous groups of objects with respect to the response classes. In the following, we consider the role played by an instrumental variable to stratify either the variables or the objects. This yields to introduce a tree-based methodology for conditional classification. Two special cases will be discussed to grow multiple discriminant trees and partial predictability trees. These approaches use discriminant analysis and predictability measures respectively. Empirical evidence of their usefulness will be shown in real case studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={We study regulation of the auditing profession in a model where audit quality is unobservable and enforcing regulation is costly. The optimal audit standard falls short of the first-best audit quality, and it is increasing in the riskiness of firms and in the amount of funding they seek. The model can encompass collusion between clients and auditors, arising from the joint provision of auditing and consulting services: deflecting collusion requires less ambitious standards. Finally, banning the provision of consulting services by auditors eliminates collusion but may not be optimal in the presence of economies of scope. © The Author 2007.

abstract={We examine investor order choices using evidence from a recent period when the NYSE trades in decimals and allows automatic executions. We analyze the decision to submit or cancel an order or to take no action. For submitted orders, we distinguish order type (market vs. limit), order side (buy vs. sell), execution method (auction vs. automatic), and pricing aggressiveness. We find that the NYSE exhibits positive serial correlation in order type on an order-by-order basis, which suggests that follow-on order strategies dominate adverse selection or liquidity considerations at a moment in time. Aggregated levels of order flow also exhibit positive serial correlation in order type, but appear to be non-stationary processes. Overall, changes in aggregated order flow have an order-type serial correlation that is close to zero at short aggregation intervals, but becomes increasingly negative at longer intervals. This implies a liquidity exhaustion-replenishment cycle. We find that small orders routed to the NYSE's floor auction process are sensitive to the quoted spread, but that small orders routed to the automatic execution system are not. Thus, in addition to foregoing price improvement, traders selecting the speed of automatic executions on the NYSE do so with little regard for the quoted cost of immediacy. As quoted depth increases, traders respond by competing on price via limit orders that undercut existing bid and ask prices. Limit orders are more likely and market sells are less likely late in the trading day. These results are helpful in understanding the order arrival process at the NYSE and have potential applications in academics and industry for optimizing order submission strategies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

First, we measure the similarity between systems built at different times for understanding the stability of the phenomenon. We apply a procedure developed for symbolic data analysis for this purpose. The procedure consists of two phases: the definition of the pseudo-panel and that of a system of rules referred to the semantic marking technique. Then, the agreement between the systems is measured. We applied such a strategy for studying the labour market accessibility for graduate in Economics, the University of Naples Federico II, and the market evolution during an eight-year time span. © 2007 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.},

abstract={Data Fusion and Data Grafting are concerned with combining files and information coming from different sources. The problem is not to extract data from a single database, but to merge information collected from different sample surveys. The typical data fusion situation formed of two data samples, the former made up of a complete data matrix X relative to a first survey, and the latter Y which contains a certain number of missing variables. The aim is to complete the matrix Y beginning from the knowledge acquired from the X. Thus, the goal is the definition of the correlation structure which joins the two data matrices to be merged. In this paper, we provide an innovative methodology for Data Fusion based on an incremental imputation algorithm in tree-based models. In addition, we consider robust tree validation by boosting iterations. A relevant advantage of the proposed method is that it works for a mixed data structure including both numerical and categorical variables. As benchmarking methods we consider explicit methods such as standard trees and multiple regression as well as an implicit method based principal component analysis. A widely extended simulation study proves that the proposed method is more accurate than the other methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={In some European countries, the liberalization of the motor insurance market in the 1990s led to substantial increases in fares and claims throughout the whole decade. In this paper we argue that these phenomena are due to the impact of liberalization on companies' optimal incentives to fight fraud. By developing a circular city competition model with a cost-reducing stage prior to the price game and a settlement stage following it, we show that price deregulation entails decreasing monitoring investments and increasing claims both in the short and long run. Even equilibrium premiums may steadily increase if the ''competition effect" connected to new entries is outweighed by a ''monitoring effect" that raises marginal costs.

abstract={The article deals with the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics for production economies with a finite set of agents, infinitely many private goods, and a set of public projects. The problem of efficiency and decentralization is addressed under the following very general assumptions: (a) the commodity-price duality is endowed with a consistent locally convex topology; (b) the set of public projects is without any mathematical structure. Moreover, any agent is characterized by a nonordered preference relation depending on consumption goods and public projects. Approximate and exact welfare theorems are discussed throughout the article. © 2007 by the Economics Department Of The University Of Pennsylvania And Osaka University Institute Of Social And Economic Research Association.},

abstract={Theory suggests that reputations allow nonanonymous markets to attenuate adverse selection in trading. We identify instances in which New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks experience trading floor relocations. Although specialists follow the stocks to their new locations, most brokers do not. We find a discernable increase in liquidity costs around a stock's relocation that is larger for stocks with higher adverse selection and greater broker turnover. We also find that floor brokers relocating with the stock obtain lower trading costs than brokers not moving and brokers beginning trading post-move. Our results suggest that reputation plays an important role in the NYSE's liquidity provision process. © 2007 by The American Finance Association.},

abstract={We argue that health care quality has an important impact on economic inequality and on saving behavior. We exploit district-wide variability in health care quality provided by the Italian universal public health system to identify the effect of quality on income inequality, health inequality and precautionary saving. We find that in lower quality districts there is greater income and health dispersion and higher precautionary saving. The analysis carries important insights for the ongoing debate about the validity of the life-cycle model and interesting policy implications for the design of health care systems.

abstract={This paper tries to identify under which conditions increasing market competition may help cooperatives to improve technical efficiency to guarantee positive profits. This hypothesis is first formalized in a partial equilibrium framework and then is tested on a sample of Italian conventional and cooperative firms, using frontier analysis. Technical efficiency indexes are computed by using the one-stage approach as suggested by Battese and Coelli (1995), where proxies for competition are introduced as determinants of efficiency, along with other exogenous factors accounting for the firms' heterogeneity. However, the overall impact of increasing competition on efficiency is negative. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Before 1992 mortgage interests in Italy were fully tax deductible up to 3500 Euro (7000 for two cosigners). In 1992-1994 the government implemented a series of tax reforms whose ultimate effect was to eliminate the relation between the after-tax mortgage rate and the marginal tax rate. Using data from the 1989-2002 Survey of Household Income and Wealth we test if the elimination of incentives has affected the sensitivity of the decision to borrow and the amount borrowed with respect to the marginal tax rate. Regression analysis and difference-in-differences estimates indicate that tax considerations have not affected the demand for mortgage debt, neither at the extensive nor intensive margin. These results are consistent with lack of financial information and credit rationing during the sample period. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A maximum theorem is proved for such a class of functions and connections with similar results are investigated. Finally, the existence of Nash equilibria for games with pseudocontinuous payoffs is obtained. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper addresses the question of the calculation of the current value of the mathematical provision and moulds it in a deterministic and stochastic scenario, using a proper term structure of interest rates estimated by means of a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. It provides a complete and original year-by-year evaluation model for the business performance, and a closed solution for the current evaluation of the reserve, together with a comprehensive insight into the dynamics of the reserve connected to the selection of a defined term structure of interest rates. Moreover, the calculation of the VaR of the mathematical provision is prospected as risk measure useful to appreciate also the evaluation rate risk. Future research prospects concern the selection of the stochastic process used to describe the dynamics of the interest rates and the possible managerial and regulatory application of a VaR measure. The modelling has been applied, as an exemplification, to a life annuity portfolio but it can be easily replicated for any kind of policy and any kind of portfolios even non homogeneous. © Rosa Cocozza, Emilia Di Lorenzo, Marilena Sibillo, 2007.},

abstract={In order to avoid 'frailty' in deterministic assumptions concerning survival law, in this paper stochastic volatility in the force of mortality is considered. In particular, mortality rates are studied by means of a stochastic model of CIR type. A method for estimating its parameters is presented and an example of application, based on simulations of the process, is shown. Empirical results and comparison with a traditional model illustrate predictive performance and the flexibility of the model. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper uses a sample of large trades executed on the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ-I market for European cross-traded firms to investigate their impact on home market prices when parallel markets suffer from information frictions. I find that (a) large London trades produce price impacts in home markets even though no timely information is published, (b) market makers appear to pre- and post-position their inventories by splitting orders across markets, and (c) the price discovery process across markets changes significantly around large trades with the foreign market making a significantly bigger contribution to price discovery at this time, even though information opaqueness exists. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This article investigates the spatial dimension of the migratory phenomenon in Italian cities. It focuses on the varying forms of migrant settlements within urban spaces, with particular reference to the case of Naples. Both residential spaces and "other" spaces are analysed in the paper, with particular attention to public spaces being transformed on the basis of the migrants' interlocking factors of belonging (gender, ethnicity, labour). The case of Naples questions conventional interpretations of migratory phenomena in Southern Italy. In the past, the position of the South within the geography of migration flows in Italy and in the Mediterranean region has been generally reduced to that of a transit area. From our point of view, however, this interpretation runs the risk of neglecting the complexity of the migration dynamics in the South of Italy. In particular, it leaves under-researched the issues related to the role played by the mobilisation of migrants' strategies and relational resources in their socio-spatial integration into the host society. For this reason, the observation of the multiple migration dynamics in Naples requires a multi-scale analytical perspective, which takes into account social and spatial practices taking shape both on a local and on a global and international level. From this perspective, Naples no longer seems an "exceptional case", as it has been conventionally regarded in the literature, but a laboratory of the emerging migration dynamics.},

abstract={The underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) is generally explained with asymmetric information and risk. We complement these traditional explanations with a new theory where investors worry also about the after-market illiquidity that may result from asymmetric information after the IPO. The less liquid the aftermarket is expected to be, and the less predictable its liquidity, the larger will be the IPO underpricing. Our model blends such liquidity concerns with adverse selection and risk as motives for underpricing. The model's predictions are supported by evidence for 337 British IPOs effected between 1998 and 2000. Using various measures of liquidity, we find that expected after-market liquidity and liquidity risk are important determinants of IPO underpricing.},

abstract={This paper presents a political economy model in which there is mutual feedback between investor protection and stockmarket development. Better investor protection induces companies to issue more equity and thereby leads to a broader stock market. In turn, equity issuance expands the shareholder base and increases support for shareholder protection. This feedback loop can generate multiple equilibria, with investor protection and stock market size being positively correlated across equilibria. The model's predictions are tested on panel data for 47 countries over 1993-2002, controlling for country and year effects and endogeneity issues. We also document international convergence in shareholder protection to best-practice standards, and show that it is correlated with cross-border mergers and acquisitions activity, consistent with the model. © 2006 by the European Economic Association.},

abstract={The theory of intertemporal consumption choice makes sharp predictions about the evolution of the entire distribution of household consumption, not just about its conditional mean. In the paper, we study the empirical transition matrix of consumption using a panel drawn from the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth. We estimate the parameters that minimize the distance between the empirical and the theoretical transition matrix of the consumption distribution. The transition matrix generated by our estimates matches remarkably well the empirical matrix, both in the aggregate and in samples stratified by education. Our estimates strongly reject the consumption insurance model and suggest that households smooth income shocks to a lesser extent than implied by the permanent income hypothesis. © 2006 by the European Economic Association.},

abstract={We study the delegation of monetary policy to independent central bankers in a two-country world with monetary spillovers. It is shown that, under the hypotheses of imperfect commitment and private information, the equilibrium degree of commitment depends on the correlation structure of the shocks hitting the economies. When the correlation is negative (as when the variance of output depends mainly on shocks to the terms of trade) there is strategic complementarity in the degree of commitment in the two countries. When the correlation is positive (common technological or demand shocks) there is strategic substitutability. In this latter case, the degree of commitment is shown to be increasing in the correlation among shocks. Common components in the international business cycle have been shown in several studies to be relatively more relevant in developed countries. Therefore, our results may contribute to explaining why the institutional solution to the inflationary bias has been adopted in the most advanced countries. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={We investigate the performance of call markets at the open and close using a unique natural experiment provided by the London Stock Exchange where traders can choose between a call and an off-exchange dealership system. Although the call market dominates dealers in terms of price discovery, it suffers from a high failure rate to open and close trading especially when trading conditions are difficult. The call's trading costs increase with asymmetric information, slow trading, order flow imbalances, and uncertainty. Traders' resort to use of call auctions is negatively correlated with firm size, implying that the call may not be the optimal method for opening and closing trading of medium and small sized stocks.

abstract={For standard irreversibility theory the prospect of acquiring better information in the future should induce more flexible decisions: the "irreversibility effect". This result relies on the definition of an irreversible position as one that would be technically or economically impossible to reverse. In practice, many positions can be reversed at an affordable cost. In this case an increase in informativeness alone is not enough to bias decisions in favour of more flexibility. We look for restrictions on decision sets, information structures and preferences that make possible to study the effect of information on flexibility. © 2005 The Geneva Association.},

abstract={Many strategies of Text Retrieval are based on Latent Semantic Indexing and its variations, by considering different weighting systems for words and documents. Correspondence Analysis and L.S.I. share the basic algebraic tool, i.e. the Singular Value Decomposition and its generalisation, related to the use of a different way for measuring the importance of each element, both in determining and representing similarities between documents and words. Aim of the paper is to propose a peculiar factorial approach for better visualizing the relations between textual data and documents, compared with classical Correspondence Analysis. Here we consider a term frequency/document frequency index scheme, mainly developed for Text Retrieval, in a textual data analysis context. An application on Italian Le Monde Diplomatique corpus (about 2000 articles published from 1998 to 2003 in the Italian edition of LMD) will show the effectiveness of the proposal. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We analyze the political determinants of investor and employment protection. Our model predicts that proportional electoral systems are conducive to weaker investor protection and stronger employment protection than majoritarian systems. This prediction is consistent with international panel data evidence. The proportionality of the voting system is significantly and negatively correlated with shareholder protection in a panel of 45 countries, and positively correlated with employment protection in a panel of 21 OECD countries. Other political variables also affect regulatory outcomes, especially for the labor market. The origin of the legal system has some additional explanatory power only for employment protection.},

abstract={An oligopolistic market in which several firms supply a homogeneous product is considered. One particular firm (leader) sets its decision prior to the other firms (followers), which react by playing a competition in quantities. The aim of the paper is to investigate the existence of suitable strategies for the leader in the presence of aggregative coupled constraints in the case in which (i) the aggregate quantity reaction Q is single-valued and (ii) the aggregate quantity reaction Q is set-valued and the leader has some probabilistic information on the followers choice in their reaction set. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={The cost of enforcing contracts is a key determinant of market performance. We document this point with reference to the credit market in a model of opportunistic debtors and inefficient courts. According to the model, improvements in judicial efficiency should reduce credit constraints and increase lending, with an ambiguous effect on interest rates that depends on banking competition and on the type of judicial reform. These predictions are supported by panel data on Italian provinces. In provinces with longer trials or large backlogs of pending trials, credit is less widely available.

abstract={If management has high private benefits and a small equity stake, managers and workers are natural allies against takeover threats. Two forces are at play. First, managers can transform employees into a "shark repellent" through long-term labor contracts and thereby reduce the firm's attractiveness to raiders. Second, employees can act as "white squires" for the incumbent managers. To protect their high wages, they resist hostile takeovers by refusing to sell their shares to the raider or by lobbying against the takeover. The model predicts that wages are inversely correlated with the managerial equity stake, and decline after takeovers.},

abstract={We study international trade in innovative goods subject to uncertain consumer health effects. Such goods are often at the center of international trade disputes. We show that an interesting form of protectionism may arise because of scientific uncertainty. A free-riding effect is identified, implying more conservative behavior by countries. We also study the role of producers (lobbies) in providing valuable information, finding that the innovative lobby has an advantage in providing information as compared with the lobby producing the 'traditional' good. Moreover, lobbies disclose more information when the health effects are long lasting. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The intimate linkages between law and finance are currently the centre of wide-ranging empirical investigations. This article presents a simple banking model with information asymmetries concerning borrowers' entrepreneurial talent. It is shown that improvements in the enforcement of contract by courts reduce agency problems but can also reduce the bank's incentive to screen borrowers adequately, thus worsening credit allocation. A stricter enforcement of credit contracts, therefore, may be socially harmful even if costlessly achieved. Improvements in accounting standards, however, always make bank screening of borrowers less costly and improve credit allocation and social welfare. © Royal Economic Society 2005.},

abstract={It is generally known that forest fires are one of the main factors of environmental degradation. Although a great deal of scientific literature on this issue exists, little progress has been made to help us understand and explain the reasons for their appearance. In this work we highlight how forest fires could also be the result of the adverse effects of environmental policies related to the management of forest fire emergencies. With regard to the area of the Gargano National Park (Southern Italy) and with the use of a panel data technique, we attempt to observe the forest fire phenomenon as related to some of the socio-economic conditions existing there. We find a significant statistical relationship between the number of forest fires and the unemployment level in the area. This provides evidence to argue that when setting up environmental safeguarding policies it is important to take into consideration the socio-economic conditions existing in the area, if the probability of adverse effects is to be avoided and a more socially responsible legislative framework is to be established.

Technical efficiency change indexes are computed by DEA. These are regressed on a measure of finance constraints to analyse their impact on firms' efficiency growth. The results support the hypothesis that a restriction in the availability of financial resources can affect positively the growth in efficiency in firms with profit-sharing schemes. © 2004.},

abstract={In this paper, we document how, in the wake of monetary unification, the markets for euro-area sovereign and private-sector bonds have become increasingly integrated. Issuers and investors alike have come to regard the euro-area bond market as a single one. Primary and secondary bond markets have become increasingly integrated on a pan-European scale. Issuance of corporate bonds has taken off on an unprecedented scale in continental Europe. In the process, both investors and issuers have reaped the considerable benefits afforded by greater competition in the underwriting of private bonds and auctioning of public ones, and by the greater liquidity of secondary markets. Bond yields have converged dramatically in the transition to EMU. The persistence of small and variable yield differentials for sovereign debt under EMU indicates that euro-area bonds are still not perfect substitutes. However, to a large extent, this does not reflect persistent market segmentation but rather small differentials in fundamental risk. Liquidity differences play at most a minor role, and this role appears to arise partly from their interaction with fundamental risk. The challenges still lying ahead are numerous. They include: the imbalance between the German-dominated futures and the underlying cash market; the vulnerability of the cash markets' prices to free-riding and manipulation by large financial institutions; the possibility of joint bond issuance by euro-area countries; the integration of clearing and settlement systems in the euro-area bond market; and the participation of new accession countries' issuers in this market. © Oxford University Press and the Oxford Review of Economic Policy Limited 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract={The current diversity in the degree of financial development across the EU can be a great opportunity at a time where this area is poised to become increasingly financially integrated. Integration should accelerate the development of the most backward financial markets, and allow companies from these countries to access more sophisticated credit and security markets. In line with a large recent literature, it is reasonable to expect that financial integration will have a 'growth dividend' in Europe. This paper attempts to quantify this growth dividend, using both industy and firm-level data to estimate the empirical relationship between financial market development and growth, and to gauge how it will distribute itself across countries and sectors. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2004.},

abstract={Nash equilibrium leaves the impression that each player foresees perfectly and responds optimally. Must human-like, rational agents really acquire both these faculties? This paper argues that in some instances neither is ever needed. For the argument repeated play is modelled here as a constrained, decentralized, second-order process driven by noncoordinated pursuit of better payoffs. Some friction feeds into - and stabilizes - a fairly myopic mode of behavior. Convergence to equilibrium therefore obtains under weak and natural conditions. An important condition is that accumulation of marginal payoffs, along the path of play, yields a sum which is bounded above.},

abstract={If the precautionary principle is to become the guide of the international community for environmental protection policies, an economic interpretation of the principle is in order. The analysis of case studies and a survey of the recent decision theoretic literature show the lack of a fully satisfactory economic model. More generally various theoretical and empirical results show that the principle cannot be assumed to apply a priori. Though it has been proposed by international treaties as a rule of thumb for situations of scientific uncertainty, the precautionary principle could actually be inefficient.},

In most, the survey is repeated over time. This allows us to construct an international dataset, merging data on 39 national household surveys with aggregate data on down payment ratios. We find strong evidence that the availability of mortgage finance - as measured by down payment ratios - affects the distribution of owner occupancy rates across age groups, especially at the young end. The results are consistent with previous theoretical models and have important implications for the debate on the relation between saving and growth. © 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The theoretical literature suggests that taxation can have a large impact on household portfolio selection and allocation. In this paper we analyze the tax treatment of life insurance, considering the cancellation of tax incentives in Italian life insurance contracts for investors with high marginal tax rates and the introduction of incentives for those with low rates. Using repeated cross-sectional data from 1989 to 1998, we find that the tax reforms had no effect on the decision to invest in life insurance or the amount invested. The likely explanations are the lack of information and lack of commitment to long-term investment. © 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We discuss the current state of stockownership among households in major European countries, drawing parallels and contrasts with the US experience. Our analysis of detailed microeconomic data documents increasing stock market participation and persistent differences across countries in our sample: many more US, UK and Swedish households participate in the stock market than is the case in the Netherlands and, especially, in France, Germany, and Italy. At the individual household level, the data indicate that stock market participation correlates robustly with wealth and education, which have only small effects, however, on the asset share invested in stocks by households who do participate. These empirical results point to the relevance of participation costs, and we find that indicators of such costs are consistent with the observed pattern of participation across countries. Over time, higher participation was brought about by lower participation costs. We discuss the possible impact of market entry by households with different characteristics, and outline types of policies that could mitigate any undesirable stock market effects of cheaper and broader participation.},

abstract={This paper documents aggregate trends in the foreign listings of companies, and analyzes their distinctive prelisting characteristics and postlisting performance. In 1986-1997, many European companies listed abroad, mainly on U.S. exchanges, while the number of U.S. companies listed in Europe decreased. European companies that cross-list tend to be large and recently privatized firms, and expand their foreign sales after listing abroad. They differ sharply depending on where they cross-list: The U.S. exchanges attract high-tech and export-oriented companies that expand rapidly without significant leveraging. Companies cross-listing within Europe do not grow unusually fast, and increase their leverage after cross-listing.},

abstract={In this paper we endogenize the information structure under price cap regulation. We show that, in order to induce the firm to acquire valuable but costly information, price cap mechanisms need to ensure high profits to the firm. Further, we compare incentives for information acquisition under price cap regulation and under the optimal mechanism designed to deal with the standard case where asymmetric information is assumed. We show that the latter provides higher incentives for information acquisition and that the welfare loss associated with price cap regulation - with respect to the optimal regulatory mechanism - increases when the issue of information acquisition is considered. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The mean and higher moments of the distribution of future income are crucial determinants of individual choices. These moments are usually estimated in panel data from past income realizations. In this article we rely instead on subjective expectations available in the 1995 Survey of Household Income and Wealth, a large random sample representative of Italian households. The survey elicits information on the distribution of future earnings and on the probability of unemployment. Analysis of this distribution helps us understand how individual uncertainty evolves over the life cycle and if attitudes toward risk affect occupational choices and income riskiness.},

abstract={We use microeconomic data on households to estimate the parameters of the demand for currency derived from a generalized Baumol-Tobin model. Our data set contains information on average currency, deposits, and other interest-bearing assets; the number of trips to the bank; the size of withdrawals; and ownership and use of ATM cards. We model the demand for currency accounting for adoption of new transaction technologies and the decision to hold interest-bearing assets. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for currency are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for currency allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey's triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population but never turns out to be very large (about 0.1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the econometric specification. In addition to the main results based on the average stock of currency, the model receives further support from the analysis of the number of trips to and average withdrawals from the bank and the ATM.},

abstract={Many economists argue that the primary economic function of banks is to provide cheap credit, and to facilitate this function, they advocate the strict protection of creditor rights. But banks can serve another important economic function: by screening projects they can reduce the number of project failures and thus mitigate their private and social costs. In this article we show that because of market imperfections in the banking industry, strong creditor protection may lead to market equilibria in which cheap credit is inappropriately emphasized over project screening. Restrictions on collateral requirements and the protection of debtors in bankruptcy may redress this imbalance and increase credit-market efficiency.},

abstract={This paper deals with a private ownership production economy assuming that the commodity space is infinite-dimensional. It is first showed that the fuzzy core allocations, a concept that goes back to J.-P. Aubin, are in a one-to-one correspondence with certain core allocations of a continuum economy suitably defined. This result is obtained under convexity of preferences and production sets and separability of the commodity space. In the case of nonconvex preferences and production sets, the set of fuzzy coalitions can be enlarged in order to obtain that every allocation of the core accordingly defined is supported by a non zero price. The proof of the equivalence result when the positive cone of the commodity space has the empty interior, is obtained under assumptions of properness for preferences relations and production sets.},

In this paper, we give a rationale for this phenomenon, based on incomplete information. Assuming that groups' quality changes over time and that banks estimate it on the basis of the past observed default rates, a result of persistent group discrimination is derived. If group reputation and high interest rates affect the firms' real quality by hampering the development of entrepreneurial skills or by inducing good firms to migrate, the initial discrimination may even cause permanent effects on the economy. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={With reference to a model of finitely additive economies, we characterize in terms of decentralizing prices several notions of core allocations resulting from different possible restrictions imposed to the set of blocking coalitions. Reciprocal relations among cores are also studied. The model we deal with is based on the coalitional one due to K. Vind. Our investigation analyzes the perfectly competitive case and extends to the oligopolistic case. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The regulations that shape the design and operations of corporations and credit and securities markets differ vastly from country to country. In addition, similar regulations are often unequally enforced in different countries. Economists still have an imperfect understanding of why these international differences exist and of whether they tend to persist over time. However, a recent strand of research has shown that some progress on these issues can be made using the approach of the new political economy, which models regulation and its enforcement as the result of the balance of power between social and economic constituencies. In this paper we offer a first assessment of the results and potential of this approach in three fields: corporate finance, banking, and securities markets.},

abstract={This paper offers a methodological contribution to the empirical analysis of the relationship between banking and economic growth by suggesting a new indicator for the state of development of the banking system based on a measure of bank microeconomic efficiency. This choice helps to overcome the problem of causality and to capture the effects of banks' activity on growth. This new approach is then applied to analyse the relationship between the banking system and economic growth in the Italian regions, through a dynamic panel technique. The empirical results show the existence of an independent effect exerted by the efficiency of banks on regional growth.},

abstract={Despite the increasing integration of capital markets, geography has not yet become irrelevant to finance. Between 1986 and 1997, European public companies have increasingly listed abroad, especially in the U.S. We relate the cross-listing decisions to the characteristics of the destination exchanges (and countries) relative to those of the home exchange (and country). European companies appear more likely to cross-list in more liquid and larger markets, and in markets where several companies from their industry are already cross-listed. They are also more likely to cross-list in countries with better investor protection, and more efficient courts and bureaucracy, but not with more stringent accounting standards. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

abstract={The theory of intertemporal choice predicts that the cross-sectional variance of the marginal utility of consumption is equal to its own lag plus a constant and a random component. Using general preference specifications and some assumptions about the nature of the random component, we provide an explicit test of this hypothesis. Our approach circumvents the necessity to identify a pure age profile of the cross-sectional variance of consumption and yields a well-specified statistical test This test is applied to data from the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy. The results are remarkably consistent with the restrictions implied by the theory of intertemporal consumption choices.},

abstract={Creditors often share information about their customers' credit records. Besides helping them to spot bad risks, this acts as a disciplinary device. If creditors are known to inform one another of defaults, borrowers must consider that default on one lender would disrupt their credit rating with all the other lenders. This increases their incentive to perform. However, sharing more detailed information can reduce this disciplinary effect: borrowers' incentives to perform may be greater when lenders only disclose past defaults than when they share all their information. In some instances, by 'fine-tuning' the type and accuracy of the information shared, lenders can raise borrowers' incentives to their first-best level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the framework of continuum economies with an infinite dimensional space of commodities, we find the measure of the set of coalitions that block a non-competitive Pareto optimal allocation. Then, from the relation between coalitions of a continuum economy with a finite number of types and fuzzy coalitions of an economy with finitely many agents, the previous results are translated as results on the measure of blocking fuzzy coalitions. Both results imply classically formulated core-Walras equivalence theorems. Finally, the measure of blocking "social communication structures" is determined. © Springer-Verlag 2000.},

abstract={This paper considers the decomposition of cost inefficiency into its technical and allocative components. First, the relevant literature is surveyed, showing that the shadow price approach has significant computational advantages over alternative procedures. To illustrate this approach, a shadow cost model is applied to a panel of dairy farms in Northern Italy, and cost inefficiency is decomposed into its technical and allocative components. The main results from this application are that the cost excess owing to inefficiency in the sample is on average 69 per cent, mainly as a result of technical inefficiency, and that allocative inefficiency relates to the under-utilisation of forage crops and of purchased feed with respect to hired labour. © Oxford University Press and Foundation for the European Review of Agricultural Economics 2000.},

abstract={Vitali spaces are a simultaneous generalization of Riesz spaces, Boolean rings, MV-algebras. We study uniformities on Vitali spaces which make lattice operations, partial sum and subtraction uniformly continuous, proving that every such uniformity is generated by its 0-neighbourhood system. This result is not true in general for lattice uniformities on lattices. As consequence we obtain general decomposition theorems for exhaustive and locally exhaustive group-valued measures and decompositions of Lebesgue and Hewitt-Yosida type.},

abstract={We analyse the effect of human capital obsolescence due to the introduction of technological innovations on the long-run growth rate, and show that in equilibrium the pace of technical change may be faster than is socially optimal. In such cases, the existence of market imperfections, and their costs for firms, may improve the welfare for the society as a whole. In particular, we assume that firms do not have full information on workers' skills but can arrange some form of internal training that permits them to acquire the lacking information. Training costs reduce research and development investments by firms and in this way draw the market equilibrium closer to the social optimum.},

abstract={Investment decisions are usually affected by what firms perceive as government supply constraints: when a firm considers whether to increase its capital stock it takes into account possible constraints due to the lack of public productive services. Introducing this consideration in a simple growth model with public services subject to congestion, I derive the possibility of low development traps for economies which start with a low level of private capital stock. At the same time, multiple equilibria, that is different long-run outcomes consistent with the same fundamentals, arise. Under some circumstances, an increase of the flow of public productive services could drive away the economy from the poverty trap. For growing economies, growth rate is positively related to the share of public spending on productive services. Empirical evidence at country level accords with implications of the model. © 2000 University of Venice.},

abstract={Several recent studies suggest that the response of national saving to fiscal policy may be non-linear. In this paper we use two data sets to search for the circumtances in which such non-linear response may arise: a sample of OECD countries, already used in previous studies, and a sample of developing countries, using more recent World Bank data. We find that in both samples non-linear effects tend to be associated with large and persistent fiscal impulses. In the OECD sample the non-linearity of the response is stronger for fiscal contractions than for expansions. An increase in net taxes has no effect on national saving during large fiscal contractions, while it has a positive effect in less pronounced contractions. High or rapidly growing public debt does not appear to be a good predictor of non-linear effects. In the World Bank sample of developing countries, non-linearities in the response national saving to fiscal policy are not limited to large fiscal contractions, and also tend to occur in periods in which debt is accumulating rapidly, regardless of its initial level.

abstract={We examine the dynamics of wealth accumulation distribution in Italy using data drawn from the Survey of Household Income and Wealth, a representative survey of the Italian population conducted by the Bank of Italy. We compare survey data with National Accounts data and discuss sample representativeness, attrition and measurement issues. We then look at wealth inequality (the cross-sectional dispersion of wealth) and wealth mobility (individual transitions across the wealth distribution) and examine the age profile of wealth using repeated cross-sectional data. Finally, we consider various explanations for the pattern of wealth accumulation in Italy, focusing on retirement, bequests, income risk, health shocks and credit market imperfections.},

abstract={We test for precautionary saving and excess sensitivity of consumption to predicted income growth using a 1989-1993 panel survey of Italian households that has measures of subjective income and inflation expectations. These expectations provide a powerful instrument for predicting income growth. The empirical specification controls for predictable changes in labor supply and allows a fairly general specification for the stochastic structure of the forecast error. We find that consumption growth is positively correlated with the expected variance of income and uncorrelated with predicted income growth. Overall, the results support the precautionary saving model.},

The aim is to investigate the agreement between dependence structures, relative to different conditions, with respect to a common set of explanatory variables. In this context, the definition of a common plane of representation is a relevant issue. A solution is proposed by referring to the geometrical features of both principal component analysis onto a reference subspace and Procrustes analysis. A practical example on sensory data regarding judgments on the Tocai friulano Italian wine finally helps in showing the feasibility of the proposed method and how well it suits the addressed problem. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to propose an extension of principal component analysis onto a reference subspace (PCAR) to the case where the same dependent variables have been measured on the same statistical units under two, or more, different observational conditions. As the units belong to the same multidimensional space, we profitably apply the orthogonal Procrustean rotations, jointly with PCAR, so as to enrich the interpretability of patterns on factorial planes. The proposed technique is applied to a problem of agreement in the area of sensory data analysis for representing evaluation gaps between the perception of quality by wine experts and ordinary consumers. The proposed approach allows to explain the eventually detected gaps in terms of the physical-chemical characteristics of wines.},

abstract={In this paper I estimate the age-wealth profile under two different identification assumptions about age, cohort and time effects. According to the life-cycle model, the two sets of assumptions should yield similar age-wealth profiles. Using the 1984-93 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth, the estimated average annual rate of wealth decumulation in old age is found to be between 3 and 6 percent. As in the life-cycle model, the cohort effect increases with year of birth. However, the results also uncover considerable population heterogeneity: the rates of wealth decumulation are much lower for rich households and households headed by individuals with higher education.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the methodological contribution given by Italian researchers in introducing a priori information into multidimensional data analysis techniques, paying special attention to categorical variables. The basic method is Non-Symmetrical Correspondence Analysis, which enables the analysis of a contingency table when the behaviour of one variable is supposed to be dependent on the other cross-classified variable. As usual correspondence analysis decomposes an association index (Pearson's Φ2), in a principal component sense, the proposed method is based on a decomposition of a predictability index (Goodman and Kruskal's τb). Non-symmetrical correspondence analysis has been extended to more than one dependent/explanatory variable(s), by means of proper flattening procedures, i.e. by the use of multiple tables, and the decomposition of Gray and Williams' multiple and partial τb's. In doing so multiple and partial versions have been proposed. A forward selection procedure for choosing the variables with higher predictive power is presented. After a brief review of non-symmetrical correspondence analysis confirmatory approach, the problem of validating results in terms of analytical stability and replication stability is faced by means of influence functions and resampling techniques.},

abstract={We analyze the welfare implications of liquidity constraints for households in an overlapping generations model with growth. In a closed economy with exogenous technical progress, liquidity constraints reduce welfare if the economy is dynamically inefficient. But if it is dynamically efficient, some degree of financial repression is required to maximize steady-state utility, even though some generations are hurt in the transition. With endogenous technical progress, financial repression may increase welfare even along the transition path, thus leading to a Pareto improvement. In this case the optimal degree of financial repression increases as the economy grows.},

abstract={Previous tests for liquidity constraints using consumption Euler equations have frequently split the sample on the basis of wealth, arguing that low-wealth consumers are more likely to be constrained. We propose alternative tests using different and more direct information on borrowing constraints obtained from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances. In a first stage we estimate probabilities of being constrained, which are then utilized in a second sample, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to estimate switching regression models of the Euler equation. Our estimates indicate stronger excess sensitivity associated with the possibility of liquidity constraints than the sample splitting approach.},

abstract={From the viewpoint of a company's controlling shareholder, the optimal ownership structure generally involves some measure of dispersion, to avoid excessive monitoring by other shareholders. The optimal dispersion of share ownership can be achieved by going public, but this choice also entails some costs (the cost of listing and the loss of control over the shareholder register). If the controlling shareholder sells shares privately instead, he avoids the costs of going public but must tolerate large external shareholders who may monitor him too closely. Thus, the owner faces a trade-off between the cost of providing a liquid market and overmonitoring. The incentive to go public is stronger, the larger the amount of external funding required. The listing decision is also affected by the strictness of disclosure rules for public relative to private firms, and the legal limits on bribes aimed at dissuading monitoring by shareholders.},

abstract={Using a large database of private firms in Italy, we analyze the determinants of initial public offerings (IPOs) by comparing the ex ante and ex post characteristics of IPOs with those of private firms. The likelihood of an IPO is increasing in the company's size and the industry's market-to-book ratio. Companies appear to go public not to finance future investments and growth, but to rebalance their accounts after high investment and growth. IPOs are also followed by lower cost of credit and increased turnover in control.},

abstract={In this paper we consider a two-stage feedback game in which two players solve a Stackelberg problem at each stage and each player knows the state of the game at every level of play. In this kind of game, the leader does not have the ability to announce his strategy at all levels of play prior to the start of the game. Without assuming that at each stage the Stackelberg problem has a unique solution, we define a concept of "feedback Stackelberg solution" and give sufficient conditions to get existence of such a solution.},

abstract={In this paper we deal with a very general form of the Yosida-Hewitt theorem on the decomposition of measures into countably additive («normal») and purely finitely additive («antinormal») parts. It expands a previous one by the authors with the aim of joining two different standpoints to the Yosida-Hewitt type theorems. The first goes back to the original publication defining the «antinormal» part as a certain disjoint complement to the «normal» one. The second approach goes deeper and characterizes this disjoint complement intrinsically i.e. as a measure, functional or operator which is equal to zero on a huge set. These two points of view are common for the publications connected, respectively, with measure theory and theory of vector lattices; the second allows important applications. The unification of these approaches gives an opportunity to derive new information in the case of vector measures. We have taken the opportunity of this paper also to furnish a survey of the topic.},

abstract={If banks have an informational monopoly about their clients, borrowers may curtail their effort level for fear of being exploited via high interest rates in the future. Banks can correct this incentive problem by committing to share private information with other lenders. The fiercer competition triggered by information sharing lowers future interest rates and future profits of banks. But, provided banks retain an initial informational advantage, their current profits are raised by the borrowers' higher effort. This trade-off determines the banks' willingness to share information. Their decision affects credit market competition, interest rates, volume of lending, and social welfare.},

abstract={Trading systems differ in their degree of transparency, here defined as the extent to which market makers can observe the size and direction of the current order flow. We investigate whether greater transparency enhances market liquidity by reducing the opportunities for taking advantage of uninformed participants. We compare the price formation process in several stylized trading systems with different degrees of transparency: various types of auction markets and a stylized dealer market. We find that greater transparency generates lower trading costs for uninformed traders on average, although not necessarily for every size of trade.},

abstract={This paper complements the analysis of the decision to go public contained in Pagano et al. (1995). We compare a larger set of Italian initial public offerings, including holding companies, with size-matched private companies. Even in this larger sample we find evidence that: (i) the new equity capital raised upon listing is not used to finance subsequent investment and growth; (ii) going public reduces the cost of credit; (iii) it is often associated with equity sales by controlling shareholders, and is followed by a higher turnover of control than for other companies. A novel finding is that the funds raised are used to purchase stakes in other companies and other financial assets.},

abstract={Economic theory suggests that uninsurable income risk and the expectation of future borrowing constraints can reduce the share of risky assets in a household's portfolio. If the utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing prudence, an individual will reduce his exposure to rate of return risks when confronted with other independent risks. If there are transaction costs, the expectation of future borrowing constraints should induce individuals to keep a lower proportion of their wealth in the form of illiquid and risky assets. We find support for these propositions in a cross-section of Italian households.},

abstract={The degree of substitution between public pensions and private wealth is tested relying on a constructed measure of social security benefits derived from households' self-reported expectations of replacement rates and retirement age. The data are drawn from the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth for the years 1989 and 1991. Each additional lira of pension wealth is estimated to reduce private wealth between 10 and 20%. This result is robust with respect to specification (linear or logarithmic), sample (one-income or two-income households) and assumptions regarding the discount factors used to compute social security wealth for both pre- and post-retirement years. The estimates suggest that the developments in the social security system in the 1970s and 1980s explain one-fifth of the fall in the Italian private saving rate. © 1995.},

abstract={A two-level optimization problem corresponding to a Stackelberg game in which one of the two players has the leadership in playing the game is considered. First, a review of previous results about existence and stability of solutions and approximate solutions is presented in the case in which the solutions set to the lower level problem is a singleton, as well as in the case in which the response function of the follower is multi-valued. Then, when some like convexity assumption on the lower level problem is not satisfied, different mixed extensions of the problem are considered and existence and stability of ε-mixed solutions introduced by the authors are investigated with respect to perturbations on the data. © 1995 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association)},

abstract={Mainly, this paper deals with cylindrical laminated panels, axially compressed under the constraint of four simply-supported edges. By imposing uniform increasing end-shortening to the two opposite circular edges, characteristic equilibrium paths have been obtained in correspondence to numerical evaluations with finite element models subject to geometric non linearity. A peculiar link among different branches of the total path, each of which is connected to a proper deformed configuration, is pointed out in the axial load/end-shortening space. Convergence problems and mesh sensibility are also examined. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={In the context of an overlapping-generations model, we show that Uquidity constraints on households (i) raise the saving rate, (ii) strengthen the effect of growth on saving, (iii) increase the growth rate if productivity growth is endogenous, and (iv) may increase welfare. The first three positions are supported by cross-country regressions of saving and growth rates on indicators of liquidity contraints on households. The results suggest that financial deregulation in the 1980s has contributed to the decline in national saving and growth rates in the OECD countries. © 1994 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={In some countries the size of the stock market and the number of listed companies have persistently lagged behind the growth of the economy. Trading externalities can help explain this fact. An entrepreneur who goes public increases risk sharing opportunities for others. This externality can lead to an inefficiently low number of listed companies and also generate multiple equilibria when flotation decisions are positively correlated across entrepreneurs. This happens if these face borrowing constraints and lack liquidity, and thus cannot diversify their portfolios unless they go public. It also happens if trading shares is costly, so that a sufficient number of issues must be listed to lure investors into the market. © 1993.},

abstract={We test for the presence of precautionary saving using a self-reported measure of earnings uncertainty drawn from the 1989 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth. The effect of uncertainty on wealth accumulation is consistent with the theory of precautionary saving and with decreasing prudence, but explains only a small fraction of saving. The results cast doubts on the empirical relevance of precautionary saving in response to earnings uncertainty, but are not in contrast with the importance of the precautionary motive per se. Beside earnings uncertainty, other risks, such as health and mortality, may be important determinants of wealth accumulation. © 1992.},

abstract={We investigate whether a system of family finance exists and to what extent it is able to offset capital market imperfections. A simple model of intergenerational transfers implies that the probability of a liquidity constrained consumer receiving a transfer is negatively correlated with his current endowment and positively correlated with his future resources. We test this proposition using a recent survey of Italian households in which both transfer recipients and liquidity constrained households are readily observable. The results indicate that private transfers help to ease borrowing constraints. However, a substantial number of liquidity constrained households remain after transfers have been made. © 1991.},

The resulting volatility can induce risk-averse transactors who face transaction costs to desert these markets. Thus thinness and the related price volatility may become joint self-perpetuating features of an equity market, irrespective of the volatility of asset fundamentals. If, however, appropriate incentive schemes are adopted to encourage entry by additional investors, this vicious circle can be broken, eventually shifting the market to a self-sustaining, superior equilibrium characterized by a higher number of transactors, lower price volatility and larger supply of the asset. © 1989 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

abstract={Since the depth and liquidity of a market depend on the entry decisions of all potential participants, each trader assesses them according to conjectures about entry by others. If trade is equally costly across markets, this externality leads to the concentration of trade on one market. If not, it can produce multiple conjectural equilibria, some where trade concentrates on one market and others where large traders resort to a separate market or to search for a trading partner. While fragmentation is welfare-reducing in the two-market case, no such ranking is possible if it involves off-exchange search. © 1989 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to analyze the optimal tax evasion decision in the context of an oligopolistic market with quantity setting firms. It is shown that the optimal amount of tax evasion for each firm depends not only on the degree of collusion in the market but also on the relative market shares of the firms; increasing collusion, however, leads to a larger amount of tax evasion in the market. It is proved that, with constant probability of detection, separability between shifting and evasion decisions holds, whereas it might fail to hold if the probability of detection is a function of the declared tax base. In this case, a probability function which decreases with the declared tax base will lead to lower evasion and lower shifting. © 1988.},

It is not clear, however, why these countries should submit themselves to such discipline. This paper argues that, to answer this question appropriately, one must consider that EMS membership brings potentially large credibility gains policy-makers in inflation-prone countries: the reason is that not only it attaches an extra penalty to inflation (in terms of real appreciation), but makes the public aware that the policy-maker is faced with such penalty, and thus helps to overcome the inefficiency stemming from the public's mistrust of the authorities. © 1988.},

This result is consistent with the findings of Fischer (1981, 1982) for the U.S. and Germany (although, in contrast to the evidence for these two countries, no relationship can be detected between unexpected inflation and relative price variability). Furthermore, the comparison between the three countries provides substantial support for the hypothesis - tentatively advanced by Fischer (1982) - that the correlation between relative price variability and inflation is enhanced by monetary accommodation of real shocks. There is also evidence that in Italy both variables have been considerably affected by exchange rate movements. © 1985.},

abstract={The volumes of mixing and dielectric constants of nitrobenzene-sulfolane mixtures were measured, at several temperatures ranging within 288.16-333.16 K, over the entire composition range. The observed deviations from ideality, decreasing with increasing temperature, are interpreted as not indicative of significant interactions between unlike molecules; autoassociation of nitrobenzene, in a small region close to pure substance, may not be quite excluded. © 1980 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The authors propose a new criterion for the evaluation of the van der Waal'volumes Vw for liquid substances. This criterion derives from simple hypotheses of interdependence between the van der Waal's volumes, the molar volumes, VO, and the vaporization enthalpies, ΔHv. For all the cases examined the estimated values of Vw are thus slightly dependent on temperature and agree with those derived from crystallographic data. It is remarkable that water presents a minimum in its Vw value at 328 K in analogy with the behaviour of the electron polarizability. For some selected organic substances an exponential empirical correlation has been found between the vaporization entropy (ΔSv)T and the [Vw/(VO - Vw)] T ratio. © 1980.},

abstract={The results of an accurate thermal analysis on highly purified samples of 2-methylpropan-2-ol supply evidence for the supposition of the existence of three crystalline phases, which we indicate as crystal I (mp 25.62°C), crystal II (mp 25.00°C), and crystal III (mp 21.66°C). A two-side transition: crystal I ⇄ II has been observed at 14.1°C. Crystal III, by cooling, undergoes a sluggish transition into crystal II at 9°C. Cryoscopic behavior of solutions of carbon tetrachloride, n-heptane, and sulfolane is consistent with the above results. Metastable equilibria may be detected owing to the fact that the freezing points of the three crystalline phases fall within a narrow temperature range. The cryoscopic constants of the three solid phases have been calculated and fusion entalpies derived. Negative conclusions are drawn concerning the use of 2-methylpropan-2-ol as a reliable solvent in cryoscopy. From thermodynamic data only crystal II is suspected, possessing some globular character. © 1979 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The solid + liquid phase diagram drawn from thermal analysis is presented. It exhibits a eutectic at x2 = 0.303 and T = 262.2 K and precludes the existence of definite compounds between the two components. Mixed crystals are observed in the sulfolane-rich region. The activity coefficients of water, fx, 1, and of sulfolane, fx, 2, are calculated from the initial freezing points of water. Log fx, 1 and log fx, 2 show a steady dependence on volume composition, providing evidence for the supposition that strongly self-associated water and monomer sulfolane scarcely interact with one another, and that the thermodynamic properties of the mixtures should rather be related to steric factors. © 1979.},
