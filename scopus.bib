abstract={In the framework of regression trees, this paper provides a recursive partitioning methodology to deal with a non-standard response variable. Specifically, either multivalued numerical or modal response of the type histogram will be considered. These data are known as symbolic data, which special cases are classical data, imprecise data, conjunctive data as well as fuzzy data. In spite of pre-processing data in order to deal with standard regression tree methodology, this paper provides, as main contribution, a definition of the impurity measure and of the splitting criterion allowing for building the regression tree for multivalued numerical response variable. We analyze and evaluate the performance of our proposal, using simulated data as well as a real-world case studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to analyze the meanings and the contents of innovation and its role in museums and heritage sites’ management to create higher levels of competitiveness. Through a complex framework, we investigate the key role of innovation in determining the competitive advantage. We propose a theoretical model to study smart and open innovation in cultural services, with specific reference to museums and heritage sites, building up an ‘innovation indicator’, in order to measure the nature and the intensity of innovation as well as to identify how it can be leveraged to sustain a business-oriented approach and to get competitive advantage. This latter is conceived in strategic terms, using a resource-based theory approach: competitive advantage is therefore considered with respect to both economic and social performance, market and competitive positioning. We apply our index on a group of innovative selected cases of museums and heritage sites using nonlinear principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Empirical results show that smart innovation seems to be a necessary path to achieve competitive parity but it is not sufficient for competitive advantage. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objectives: The role of dental professionals in screening for oral cancer has been limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the educational priorities of oral medicine specialists, general dental practitioners, and doctors of dental surgery with regards to the diagnosis and management of oral cancers and potential malignant disorders. Study Design: This was a longitudinal survey. Materials and Methods: A Delphi survey was directed to a panel of 25 oral medicine specialists asking them to identify the major difficulties in diagnosing and managing patients with oral cancer or suspected malignancy. In a second phase, two groups of generalists were asked to express their ratings on the issues identified by experts. Results: The response rate of the experts to the survey was 84%, while only 44% of the generalists participated. Although the three groups agreed on most of the issues, there were significant differences of opinions on 10 of the items proposed by specialists (P < 0.05 from the Kruskal-Wallis test), which were observed mainly between experts and general dental practitioners (P < 0.017 from the Mann-Whitney U test). The opinion of the participants about future investments in the field of education resulted in similar results (P > 0.05 from the Chi-square test), with the specialists ranking highest on mandatory annual thematic courses, while the generalists prioritizing more interactive and extensive pre-graduation courses on oral cancer detection. Conclusion: This study confirms a clear need to improve the educational foundation on oral cancer by a didactic process starting with pre-graduation courses that should involve National Health Care Services, National Dental Associations, and academia. © 2016 Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

abstract={This paper constitutes Part I of the contribution to the analysis of web visit histories through a new methodological framework. Firstly, web usage and web structure mining are considered as an unique mining process to detect the latent structure of the web navigation across the web sections of a single portal. We extend association rules theory to web data defining new concepts of web (patterns) association and preference matrices, as well as of (indirect and direct) sequence rules. We identify the most significant rules, according to a multiple testing procedure. In the literature, web usage patterns can be visualized in no-distance-based graphs describing the navigation behavior across web pages with sequential arrows. In the following, we introduce a geometrical visualization of sequence rules at any click of the web navigation. In particular, we provide two distance-based visualization methods for the static analysis of all data tout court and the dynamic analysis to discover the most significant web paths click by click. A real world case study is considered throughout the methodological description. © 2016, Classification Society of North America.},

abstract={This research paper focuses on coopetition among small and medium tourism enterprises (SMEs), and has two objectives. First it makes a theoretical contribution by establishing a model of variables that induce coopetition, the degrees to which coopetition exists and the relationship between those variables and firm performance. Second, it tests the modeling in the context of the tourism industry in Naples and Sorrento, Italy. The former comprises a sample of 149 accommodation providers and the latter 169. Building on survey data and local linkages between accommodation providers and SMEs in tourism it is found that coopetition improves performance but a key determinant is not only numbers of links but also acquired trust between partners. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Butterfly communities can be modified by the activities of large mammals. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most common mammals in Europe and has notably expanded its distribution range in recent decades. The present work aimed to investigate the possible effect of wild boar rooting activity on butterflies in olive groves inside the “Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni” National Park. Butterflies were surveyed in five Rooted (R) and five Control areas (C). Transects were made from April to September in 2011 and 2012. Forty-three species and 3659 individuals were found, of which 39 species and 2426 individuals were detected in C areas and 31 species and 1233 individuals in R areas. A community-level approach showed a significantly higher abundance, richness and Shannon–Wiener index in C than in R. An ecological-level approach indicated that more specialised butterflies were significantly more affected by wild boar activity. Finally, the response of single species was investigated: two species (Colias croceus and Polyommatus icarus) were significantly more represented in R, whereas six species (Aricia agestis,Hipparchiastatilinus, Lasiommata megera, Melanargia arge, Pyronia cecilia and Thymelicus acteon) were significantly more abundant in C. Three species considered at risk (M. arge; Annex II of Directive 92/43/EEC; H. statilinus and T. acteon: European Red List) were less represented in rooted areas. Overall, the intensive wild boar activity negatively correlated with butterflies in the olive groves studied. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The nervus terminalis (NT) is the most anterior of the vertebrate cranial nerves. In teleost fish, the NT runs across all olfactory components and shows high morphological variability within this taxon. We compare the anatomical distribution, average number and size of the FMRFamide-immunoreactive (ir) NT cells of fourteen teleost species with different positions of olfactory bulbs (OBs) with respect to the ventral telencephalic area. Based on the topology of the OBs, three different neuroanatomical organizations of the telencephalon can be defined, viz., fish having sessile (Type I), pseudosessile (short stalked; Type II) or stalked (Type III) OBs. Type III topology of OBs appears to be a feature associated with more basal species, whereas Types I and II occur in derived and in basal species. The displacement of the OBs is positively correlated with the peripheral distribution of the FMRFamide-ir NT cells. The number of cells is negatively correlated with the size of the cells. A dependence analysis related to the type of OB topology revealed a positive relationship with the number of cells and with the size of the cells, with Type I and II topologies of OBs showing significantly fewer cells and larger cells than Type III. A dendrogram based on similarities obtained by taking into account all variables under study, i.e., the number and size of the FMRFamide-ir NT cells and the topology of OBs, does not agree with the phylogenetic relationships amongst species, suggesting that divergent or convergent evolutionary phenomena produced the olfactory components studied. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The role of observational learning in dogs has drawn great interest from the scientific community. However, only a few studies explored its potential use for training purposes. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential benefit of conspecific observational learning in a dog training context. Fifty adult Labrador retrievers were recruited at the Italian Water Rescue School. Dogs were equally distributed between basic and advanced training level and assigned to demonstration and control groups.The experimental procedure consisted of two phases: Phase 1, intended to ascertain that dogs could not perform the selected exercise when requested by their handlers; Phase 2, to assess whether they would perform the same exercise after the observation of a conspecific demonstrator. The tests were performed outdoors in a fenced training area and one out of two dynamic exercises were selected for each dog: jumping on a trunk or hop on a slide for children. The outcome of Phase 2 was coded into a binary variable as successful or unsuccessful and a generalized linear model with binary logistic link function was used to analyze outcomes. The model included the dog's age as a covariate and the experimental group, level of experience, sex and all two-ways interactions as fixed factors. The dogs' probability to replicate the action increased significantly after demonstration by a conspecific compared to a control group and such probability improves with age. This study supports the usefulness of the intraspecific observational learning in adult dogs for training purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The psychological aspect in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is poorly documented. We sought to determine the role of DEB in anxiety, depression and self-esteem. We conducted a cross-sectional study, collecting data from 27 DEB patients and 26 healthy individuals. DEB patients and healthy controls completed three different psychometric scales for anxiety and depression and one scale for self-esteem. DEB patients and healthy controls were homogeneous for age and sex (P > 0.05), but not for employment, marital status and economic level (P < 0.05). Median values of all psychometric battery scales were not statistically significant between DEB patients and healthy controls, except for Goldberg scale for anxiety (P = 0.003) and depression (P = 0.037) and slightly significant for Zung Scale for anxiety (P = 0.048) with no difference between DEB patients with dominant versus recessive form in all scales (P > 0.05). Among DEB patients, only employment showed a significant difference in all scales (P < 0.05) but Hamilton for depression, whereas self-esteem seemed to be affected by marriage (P = 0.04) and education (P = 0.016). DEB patients apparently are not more anxious and/or depressed and do not have less self-esteem than healthy individuals. © 2015 Japanese Dermatological Association.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the possible crosstalk between C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)/C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) axis with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Methods: Sixty-one human NETs were included into the study. CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis and mTOR pathway were assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effect of mTOR inhibitor, RAD001, was evaluated on CXCR4 pathway through proliferation and p-Erk and p-AKT induction. Results: CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis and p-mTOR were found to be active and correlated with grading, Ki67 index and tumor stage. mTOR pathway activation significantly correlated with poor prognosis. In human NET cells, CXCL12 induced mTOR signalling while AMD3100 (CXCR4-antagonist) impaired it. The mTOR-antagonist, RAD001, impaired the CXCL12- dependent induction of CXCR4 downstream effectors. Combination of AMD3100 and RAD001 potentiate cell growth inhibition. Conclusions: CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis is active in NETs and signals on mTOR. CXCR4 might be considered a prognostic factor in NETs. Combined treatment with AMD3100 and RAD001 may provide clinical benefits in NET patients with drugresistant.},

abstract={Objective: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and their relationship with pain. Design: Cross-sectional clinical study. Setting: University-Hospital. Subjects: 75 BMS patients were enrolled. Methods: The study was conducted between September 2011 and March 2012 at the "Federico II" University of Naples. Demographic characteristics and clinical information including age, sex, educational level, marital status, job status, age at disease onset, oral symptoms, and triggers were collected via questionnaire interviews. To assess pain intensity the visual analogue scale (VAS) was administered. Descriptive statistics were collected, and Pearson Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests and the Spearman bivariate correlation were performed. Results: The mean age was 61.17 (±11.75, female/male ratio=3:1). The mean age at disease onset was 56.75 (±12.01). A low educational level (8.57±4.95) and 80% of unemployment were found. Job status and age at disease onset correlated with the VAS scale (P=0.019 and P=0.015, respectively). Tongue morphology changes, taste disturbances, and intraoral foreign body sensation have a significant dependence on gender (P=0.049, 0.001, and 0.045, respectively); intraoral foreign body sensation has a significant dependence on marital status (P=0.033); taste disturbances have a significant dependence on job status. (P=0.049); xerostomia has a significant dependence on age (P=0.039); and tongue color changes and a bitter taste have a significant dependence on educational level (P=0.040 and 0.022, respectively). Marital status and educational level have a significant dependence on the triggers (P=0.036 and 0.049, respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of BMS is higher in women, and in married, unemployed, and less highly educated patients. Burning is the most frequent symptom while stressful life events are the most frequent trigger reported. © 2015 American Academy of Pain Medicine.},

abstract={The most common approach to build a decision tree is based on a twostep procedure: growing a full tree and then prune it back. The goal is to identify the tree with the lowest error rate. Alternative pruning criteria have been proposed in literature. Within the framework of recursive partitioning algorithms by tree-based methods, this paper provides a contribution on both the visual representation of the data partition in a geometrical space and the selection of the decision tree. In our visual approach the identification of the best tree and of the weakest links is immediately evaluable by the graphical analysis of the tree structure without considering the pruning sequence. The results in terms of error rate are really similar to the ones returned by the classification and regression trees (CART) procedure, showing how this new way to select the best tree is a valid alternative to the wellknown cost-complexity pruning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

abstract={The present study aimed at evaluating possible behavioural differences between guide dogs living in a kennel and interacting with a trainer and those living in a house and interacting with a blind person and their family, when they are faced with an unsolvable task. Fifty-two Labrador retrievers were tested: 13 Trained Guide dogs at the end of their training programme and 11 Working Guide dogs that had been living with their blind owner for at least 1 year. Two control groups of Labrador retrievers were also tested: 14 Young Untrained dogs of the same age as the Trained Guide and 14 Old Untrained dogs of the same age as the Working Guide dogs. Results showed that the Trained Guide dogs gazed towards the owner or the stranger for less time and with a higher latency and spent more time interacting with the experimental apparatus than the other three groups, which all behaved similarly. None of the groups tested showed preferences in gazing towards the stranger or the owner. Together, the results suggest that at the end of their training programme, guide dogs are less prone to engage in human-directed gazing behaviour and more likely to act independently when facing an unsolvable task. Conversely, guide dogs that have been living with a blind person (and their family) for 1 year behave like pet dogs. These findings indicate that guide dogs’ gazing towards humans is favoured by living in close proximity with people and by interacting with them. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background Gingival lesions in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) are a common manifestation. However, their clinical features, frequency and severity are currently unknown. Methods Forty-five DEB patients were assessed by an oral medicine specialist, who analysed the presence/absence of four clinical signs (erythema, erosion/ulcer, atrophy, blister) on free and attached gingiva, using the Epidermolysis Bullosa Oropharyngeal Severity score. Results Twenty-eight (62.2%) out of 45 DEB patients showed different types of gingival lesions, whose presence/absence and total frequency/distribution were not significantly different between males and females (p = 0.087 and p = 0.091, respectively). Erythema was the most prevalent lesion (66.2%) and the recessive DEB severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen) reached the highest median disease activity score. A significant correlation was observed between the DEB subtypes and the disease activity median score (p < 0.001), but not between age and total disease activity score in each group of DEB (p > 0.05). Lastly, logistic regression showed that only gender (p = 0.031) and RDEB-sev gen (p = 0.001) were risks factors for the presence of gingival lesions. Conclusions Gingival lesions in DEB patients are a relatively common entity and may have multiple clinical aspects, emphasizing the need for thorough attention and awareness among dentists. © 2015 Australian Dental Association.},

abstract={The most common approach to build a decision tree is based on a twostep procedure: growing a full tree and then prune it back. The goal is to identify the tree with the lowest error rate. Alternative pruning criteria have been proposed in literature. Within the framework of recursive partitioning algorithms by tree-based methods, this paper provides a contribution on both the visual representation of the data partition in a geometrical space and the selection of the decision tree. In our visual approach the identification of the best tree and of the weakest links is immediately evaluable by the graphical analysis of the tree structure without considering the pruning sequence. The results in terms of error rate are really similar to the ones returned by the classification and regression trees (CART) procedure, showing how this new way to select the best tree is a valid alternative to the wellknown cost-complexity pruning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={To improve highway design consistency, several studies developed operating speed prediction models and investigated drivers' speed behavior. Most existing models are based on spot speed data that assume constant operating speed throughout the horizontal curves and occurrence of acceleration and deceleration only on tangents. To overcome limitations associated with existing models, this study investigated continuous speed profiles with an experiment that used a high-fidelity dynamic driving simulator on a two-lane highway. A piecewise linear regression model and locally weighted regression scatter-plot smoothing were used to remove noise in the data set while preserving underlying patterns and to identify significant changes in the speed profile. Based on the smoothed speed profiles, models to predict operating speed in curves and in tangents, deceleration and acceleration rates to be used in the operating speed profiles, and starting and ending points of constant operating speed in curve were developed. Radius of the curve notably affected not only the operating speed in the curve but also the operating speed of the tangent following the curve: the smaller the radius, the lower the operating speed of the exit tangent. Both acceleration and deceleration rates increased with curvature. This study found that operating speed was not constant along curves. On small radius curves, deceleration ended close to the center of the curve, and acceleration starts, close to the end of the curve. Increasing the curve radius, the end point of deceleration moves toward the curve's beginning, whereas the start of acceleration moves toward the center of the curve.},

abstract={Background: The psychological factors and their association with chronic inflammatory disease, aren't well recognized, yet their importance in oral lichen planus is still debated. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression and their association in patient with oral lichen planus. Materials and methods 50 patients with oral lichen planus vs. equal number of age and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Questionnaires examining insomnia symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness (Pittsburgh sleep quality index and Epworth aleepiness scale) depression and anxiety (The Hamilton rating scale for Depression and Anxiety) were used. Results: The patients with oral lichen planus had statistically higher scores in all items of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Hamilton rating scale for depression and anxiety and Epworth sleepiness scale than the healthy controls. The median and inter-quartile range of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index was 5-2 and for the oral lichen planus patients and 4-2 for the healthy controls (P < 0.011). In the study group, a depressed mood and anxiety correlated positively with sleep disturbances. The Pearson correlations were 0.76 for Pittsburgh sleep quality Index vs. Hamilton rating scale for depression (P < 0.001) and 0.77 for Pittsburgh sleep quality Index vs. Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (P < 0.001). Discussion Oral lichen planus patients report a greater degree of sleep problems, depressed mood and anxiety as compared with controls.

abstract={Objective Erythema multiforme (EM) continues to be an underestimated disease with a lack of strict classification and diagnostic criteria. We present the analysis of a case series of 60 oral EM patients from 2 centers and illustrate the range of oral clinical presentations. Study Design Clinical data from 60 EM patients with oral involvement, diagnosed and treated between 1982 and 2014, were retrospectively collected from the archives of 2 independent hospitals. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the Pearson χ-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Result Thirty-one patients (51.7%) were male and 29 (48.3%) were female, with a mean (±SD) age of 37.9 years (±18.1). The frequency of previous occurrences ranged from 0 to 10 (mean ± SD: 1.4 ± 2.0). Twenty-nine patients (48%) had no previous occurrence. Medications (particularly antipyretics, food additives, and antibiotics) were the suspected precipitants in 28 patients (46.7%), whereas herpes simplex virus infection was suspected in 18 (30.0%). All but 1 patient had involvement of multiple oral sites, with the buccal mucosa being the most commonly involved oral site (75%), followed by the vermillion border (71.7%). Conclusions Patients with EM may present initially to oral health care workers. Medications and herpes simplex virus continue to be the most typically involved precipitating factors. Our data highlight the additional role of food-derived antigens. Although laboratory tests can provide support diagnostically, EM diagnosis continues to be based on clinical features. A medication and food diary should be encouraged particularly in patients with recurrent forms. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Abstract: In the Mediterranean landscape fires are common, sometimes arising due to human activity. Fire influences the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground, thus affecting the diversity and distribution of animal and plant species. In this study, we analysed the effect of fire on butterfly diversity at the Site of Community Importance (SCI) “Monti di Lauro” (IT8040013) in southern Italy (Campania). The area covers 7040 ha and is mainly characterised by Mediterranean maquis and woody vegetation. We compared the flight activity of butterflies before and after a fire incident in October 2008. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and 2009. From the transect data, we calculated several diversity indices. We surveyed 55 species and 5052 individuals (2008: 43 species, 1764 individuals; 2009: 49 species, 3288 individuals). Inter-year comparisons showed that richness was significantly lower in 2008 than in 2009, as well as the abundance; the evenness index was significantly higher in 2008 than in 2009. Intra-year comparisons before fire (2008) showed significant differences among months in all indices analysed, whereas after fire (2009), only evenness differed significantly. Our results show that after fire in the Mediterranean maquis, a rapid change in butterfly community structure occurred, increasing both species and individual abundance. Nevertheless, a lower evenness indicates a less balanced butterfly community after fire. Notably, Melanargia arge, a protected species by the Habitats Directive, was not observed following the fire. © 2014, © 2014 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

NADPH-d-positive fibers are present throughout much of the brain, whereas stained cell groups are distributed in well-defined regions. Whereas most brain areas consistently show positive neurons in all species, in some areas species-specific differences occur. We analyzed our data and those available for other amphibian species to build a matrix on NADPH-d brain distribution for a multivariate analysis. Brain dissimilarities were quantified by using the Jaccard index in a hierarchical clustering procedure. The whole brain dendrogram was compared with that of its main subdivisions by applying the Fowlkes-Mallows index for dendrogram similarity, followed by bootstrap replications and a permutation test. Despite the differences in the distribution map of the NADPH-d system among species, cluster analysis of data from the whole brain and hindbrain faithfully reflected the evolutionary history (framework) of amphibians. Dendrograms from the secondary prosencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and isthmus showed some deviation from the main scheme. Thus, the present analysis supports the major evolutionary stability of the hindbrain. We provide evidence that the NADPH-d system in main brain subdivisions should be cautiously approached for comparative purposes because specific adaptations of a single species could occur and may affect the NADPH-d distribution pattern in a brain subdivision. The minor differences in staining pattern of particular subdivisions apparently do not affect the general patterns of staining across species. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Previous investigations have attempted to correlate the genotype with the cutaneous phenotype in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), but never with the oropharyngeal phenotype. Seventeen dystrophic EB (DEB) patients were genotyped for COL7A1 gene mutations and divided into five distinct groups. Oropharyngeal disease severity was assessed with the Epidermolysis Bullosa Oropharyngeal Severity (EBOS) score by an oral medicine specialist. The genotype-phenotype correlation was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance using the Mann-Whitney test, applying the Bonferroni correction. The most severe oropharyngeal phenotype was found in the group with the 2470insG/3948insT mutation, with a mean disease severity score of 18.50 ± 2.12; the mildest was found in the 6862del16 mutation group, with a mean disease severity score of 0.57 ± 1.13. The most significant difference in median score was found in the total score (P = 0.009), followed by tongue (P = 0.02) and upper lip (P = 0.021), but no correlation was found between disease severity and the groups (P > 0.005, after Bonferroni correction). Multiple comparisons among the five different genotypic groups revealed no statistically significant genotype-oropharyngeal phenotype correlation; it was not possible to establish which group was more severe, or to associate a specific mutation to a specific oropharyngeal phenotype. © 2013 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

abstract={The literature on inter-firm collaboration primarily concentrates on successful cases and tries to explain why and how they obtained their success. On the other hand, there are fewer contributions that study the reasons for inter-firm relationships failure. This paper responds to that deficiency by providing evidence as to why inter-firm collaboration fails, and identifies processes where it is possible to pass from a difficult and complex relationship (where mutual trust is not notably present) to situations of recovery and re-positioning. Empirical evidence is presented from two specific areas in the Campania Region (Italy) to test a proposed theoretical model that identifies the importance of partners' previous experience and their awareness of the importance of inter-firm cooperation as determinants of the survival and success of the collaboration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The paper aims to illustrate the stance of existing research on governance in healthcare organizations (hereafter HCOs), in order to appreciate the structure of literature and its evolution. More specifically, thorough a keywords analysis of 91 articles published in 1985-2010 timeframe, the article attempts to understand how setting peculiarities affect the healthcare governance field and to provide some suggestions for future research. The findings enlighten the existence of three main research streams, as well as the absence of a research evolution. The novelty of the paper relies on its contributions for academics by providing a keywords map as a useful tool to understand greatest concentration areas and vice versa never investigated issues whereon focusing future efforts.

abstract={Objective. To evaluate the internal consistency of the epidermolysis bullosa oropharyngeal severity score (EBOS). Materials and methods. Data from 92 patients of varying EB types/sub-types already described in a previous multi-center study were re-analyzed via the coefficient Cronbach's α (CR-α). Additionally, the corrected item total correlation between each item and the items' overall score with Pearson's product-moment correlation (ρ) was calculated. Results. The alpha coefficient for the mean total score of 17 items is 0.941. The inter-observer reliability for disease severity score was excellent for oral medicine specialist (α = 0.924) and dermatologist (α = 0.916) and the intra-observer reliability was good at Time 1 (α = 0.895) and Time 2 (α = 0.897). The analysis of CR-α per single item revealed that alpha was greater than 0.904 for disease activity and 0.743 for structural damage, after the elimination of four items for oral medicine specialist and greater than 0.898 for disease activity and 0.769 for structural damage after the elimination of five items for dermatologist. Similarly the analysis of the corrected items-EBOS correlation showed that the same items do not correlate very well (ρ < 0.4) with the overall EBOS. Conclusions. The EBOS turned out to have a strong and reliable internal consistency, as the majority of the EBOS' items were consistent with each other. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract={An agronomic research was conducted in Tuscany (Central Italy) to evaluate the effects of an advanced irrigation system on the water use efficiency (WUE) of a tomato crop and to investigate the ability of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry to detect and map WUE. Irrigation was applied following an innovative approach based on CropSense system. Soil water content was monitored at four soil depths (10, 20, 30 and 50cm) by a probe. Rainfall during the crop cycle reached 162mm and irrigation water applied with a drip system amounted to 207mm, distributed with 16 irrigation events. Tomato yield varied from 7.10 to 14.4kgm-2, with a WUE ranging from 19.1 to 38.9kgm-3. The irrigation system allowed a high yield levels and a low depth of water applied, as compared to seasonal ET crop estimated with Hargraves' formula and with the literature data on irrigated tomato. Measurements were carried out on geo-referenced points to gather information on crop (crop yield, eighteen Vegetation indices, leaf area index) and on soil (spectroradiometric and traditional analysis). Eight VIs, out of nineteen ones analyzed, showed a significant relationship with georeferenced yield data; PVI maps seemed able to return the best response, before harvesting, to improve the knowledge of the area of cultivation and irrigation system. CropSense irrigation system reduced seasonal irrigation volumes. Some vegetation indexes were significantly correlated to tomato yield and well identify, a posteriori, crop area with low WUE; spectroradiometry can be a valuable tool to improve irrigated tomato field management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to better understand how mandatory risk categories are disclosed and to provide a better understanding of the reasons why risk disclosure looks less useful than it ought to be. Design/methodology/approach – We analyze how Italian banks provide risk information, by focusing on its characteristics to find out any differences between the notes to the financial statements and the public report, both prepared in compliance with the instructions of the Bank of Italy. We assess the risk-related reporting practices of 66 Italian banks, based on a content analysis of the two mandatory reports, and verify whether bank-specific factors explain any differences. Findings – Italian banks formally comply with the Bank of Italy’s instructions, but there is discretion to choose the characteristics of the information provided. Despite different risk categories to disclose in each report, disclosure is quite uniform, although banks tend to provide denser information in the notes to the financial statements and the difference in the economic signs between the two reports decreases as the level of risk increases. Practical implications – The significance of this study goes beyond the debate taking place in the academic arena, as it can be largely relevant for preparers, those responsible for setting international and national accounting standards, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the domestic supervisory authorities, particularly concerning the possible introduction of requirements that are more explicit than the existing ones. Originality/value – The Italian setting is very relevant because unlike other countries, Italy adopts “interventionist enforcements”, which are regarded as a critical tool for achieving the minimum disclosure requirements. Moreover, the two sets of disclosure required by the Bank of Italy have never been investigated in a single data set. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: The oral mucosa in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) can be affected with different lesions and degrees of severity. However, patterns of oral lesions in distinct types of EB are still unclear. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and distribution of four types of lesions (erythema, erosion, atrophy, and blister) for each oral site and to calculate the interobserver reliability for each type of lesion in each site. Methods: Ninety-two patients with different EB types were assessed independently by an oral medicine specialist and a dermatologist. The degree of agreement was calculated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The most affected oral site was the tongue, with the most frequent lesion being erythema and atrophy [54(58.7%) patients] for the oral medicine specialist and erosion [54(58.7%) patients] for the dermatologist. Patients with recessive dystrophic EB-severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen) showed the highest mean of sites involved by each lesion for both oral medicine and dermatology. The interobserver reliability on the total of lesions was excellent on only 3 sites: lower lip (ICC: 0.89; 95%CI:0.83-0.92), hard palate (ICC:0.85; 95%CI:0.72-0.91), and tongue (ICC:0.89; 95%CI:0.84-0.92), whereas the interobserver reliability calculated for each single oral lesion showed a lower agreement. Conclusion: Total distribution of sites involved by four types of lesions was higher in RDEB-sev gen than in the rest of EB types, with a predominance of erythema followed by erosion. The agreement on the type of lesion was found to be poor-moderate for many oral sites. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Fifty BMS patients were compared with an equal number of healthy controls matched for age, sex, and educational level. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) were administered. Descriptive statistics, including the Mann-Whitney U test and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were used. BMS patients had higher scores in all items of the PSQI and ESS than the healthy controls (P < .001). In the BMS patients, a depressed mood and anxiety correlated positively with sleep disturbances. The Pearson correlations were 0.68 for PSQI vs HAM-D (P < .001) and 0.63 for PSQI vs HAM-A (P < .001). BMS patients reported a greater degree of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression as compared with controls. Sleep disorders could influence quality of life of BMS patients and could be a possible treatment target.},

abstract={Background: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a genetic mucocutaneous disorder characterized by blister formation upon mild trauma. All 4 EB types may show oropharyngeal lesions involving either hard or soft tissues. Currently, there are very few data on EB scoring that include the oropharyngeal cavity. Objectives: We sought to develop an oropharyngeal severity score that was objective, valid, reliable, reproducible, easy to perform, and appropriate for all EB types. Methods: In this study, oral medicine specialists developed a new score, the EB Oropharyngeal Severity (EBOS) score. This measured oropharyngeal disease activity (erythema, atrophy, blisters, erosion/ulceration) and structural damage (microstomia, ankyloglossia, scarring phenotype beyond microstomia and ankyloglossia, enamel hypoplasia). It was tested on 92 patients with different types/subtypes of EB, and interobserver and intraobserver reliability were assessed. Results: The EBOS mean total score was 12.9 ± 10.9 (range: 0-34). Both interobserver and intraobserver reliability for total score on all patients with EB were considered excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.96 and intraclass correlation coefficient 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.94, respectively). Even analyzing each single parameter of the disease activity and structural damage, a substantial to excellent correlation was found in the interobserver (except for 4 sites) and intraobserver reliability. A significant correlation was found between EB types/subtypes and the EBOS median score (P < .001), but not between age and the EBOS mean total score in each group. Limitations: The sample size was small and the number of EB subtypes was limited. Conclusions: The EBOS score seems to represent an instrument capable of truly quantifying the oropharyngeal severity in different types/subtypes of EB, demonstrating excellent interobserver and intraobserver reliability. © 2012 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.},

abstract={Aim of the study was the analysis of powered two-wheeler (PTW) crashes in Italy in order to detect interdependence as well as dissimilarities among crash characteristics and provide insights for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on PTWs. At this aim, data mining techniques were used to analyze the data relative to the 254,575 crashes involving PTWs occurred in Italy in the period 2006-2008. Classification trees analysis and rules discovery were performed. Tree-based methods are non-linear and non-parametric data mining tools for supervised classification and regression problems. They do not require a priori probabilistic knowledge about the phenomena under studying and consider conditional interactions among input data. Rules discovery is the identification of sets of items (i.e., crash patterns) that occur together in a given event (i.e., a crash in our study) more often than they would if they were independent of each other. Thus, the method can detect interdependence among crash characteristics. Due to the large number of patterns considered, both methods suffer from an extreme risk of finding patterns that appear due to chance alone. To overcome this problem, in our study we randomly split the sample data in two data sets and used well-established statistical practices to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Both the classification trees and the rules discovery were effective in providing meaningful insights about PTW crash characteristics and their interdependencies. Even though in several cases different crash characteristics were highlighted, the results of the two the analysis methods were never contradictory. Furthermore, most of the findings of this study were consistent with the results of previous studies which used different analytical techniques, such as probabilistic models of crash injury severity. Basing on the analysis results, engineering countermeasures and policy initiatives to reduce PTW injuries and fatalities were singled out. The simultaneous use of classification trees and association discovery must not, however, be seen as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method which can be integrated into other safety analyses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Framework of this paper is statistical data editing, specifically how to edit or impute missing or contradictory data and how to merge two independent data sets presenting some lack of information. Assuming a missing at random mechanism, this paper provides an accurate tree-based methodology for both missing data imputation and data fusion that is justified within the Statistical Learning Theory of Vapnik. It considers both an incremental variable imputation method to improve computational efficiency as well as boosted trees to gain in prediction accuracy with respect to other methods. As a result, the best approximation of the structural risk (also known as irreducible error) is reached, thus reducing at minimum the generalization (or prediction) error of imputation.

abstract={Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) and breast cancer (BC) are the two most common diseases associated with bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ), for which different therapeutical approaches have been proposed. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical behaviour of BRONJ in patients with MM vs. BC and the time of healing in terms of clinical and symptomatological remission, following a standardized therapeutic protocol. Methods: Twenty-six BRONJ patients (13 men with MM and 13 women with BC) were prospectively enroled and treated with a specific systemic and topical antibiotic therapy. Several predictors of outcome were also evaluated. Results: Nine patients (69.2%) with BC and 10 patients (76.9%) with MM progressed towards a complete clinical remission (CR) in a mean healing time of 183.3days [SD: 113.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 95.95-207.7] and 372.0days (SD: 308.0; 95% CI: 151.7-592.3) (P=0.776), respectively. The clinical improvement was statistically significant (P=0.0013 and P=0.0014), as well as the assessment of pain (P=0.0015 and P=0.0015), in MM and BC group, respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed that just triggering events (P=0.036) were found to be significant predictors of outcome of BRONJ healing. Conclusions: Both groups of cancer patients experienced clinical and symptomatological remission regardless their malignancy, but BC patients earlier than MM patients. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Exploratory analysis was made of data from pedestrian crashes to detect interdependence and dissimilarities between crash patterns and to provide insight for the development of safety improvement strategies focused on pedestrians. Data-mining techniques, such as classification trees and association rules, were used on data related to 56,014 pedestrian crashes that occurred in Italy from 2006 to 2008. Crash severity was the response variable most sensitive to crash patterns. The most influential crash patterns were road type, pedestrian age, lighting conditions, vehicle type, and interactions between these patterns. Notable results included associations between fatal crashes and rural areas, urban provincial and national roads, pedestrians older than 75 years, nighttime conditions, pedestrians older than 65 years in nighttime crashes, drivers' young age and male gender in nighttime crashes, and truck involvement. To mitigate the fatal crash patterns identified by the classification trees and association rules, several measures are suggested for implementation. Results of the study are consistent with results of previous studies that used other analytic techniques, such as probabilistic models of crash injury severity. The data-mining techniques used in the study were able to detect interdependencies among crash characteristics. The use of classification trees and association rules, however, must be seen not as an attempt to supplant other techniques, but as a complementary method that can be integrated into other safety analyses.},

abstract={Aim of the study was to investigate, by means of a driving simulator experiment, drivers' behaviour in terms of speed, deceleration, and lateral position on major approaches of rural intersections in relation to different perceptual cues. In the experiment, ten different design conditions with and without speed-reducing treatments along the approach to the intersection were tested. Twenty-three drivers drove a test route two times and data from the second drive were used for comparison. The order of the ten design conditions was counterbalanced for all the drivers to minimize the presentation order effect. Three different data analysis techniques were used: (a) cluster analysis of speed and lateral position data, (b) statistical tests of speed and lateral position data, and (c) categorical analysis of deceleration behaviour patterns. The most effective treatments were the dragon teeth markings (based on the principle of optical road narrowing), the colored intersection area (based on the principle of intersection highlighting), and the raised median island (based on the principle of physical road narrowing). These measures, in comparison to the base intersection, produced: (1) a significant speed reduction starting from 250 m before the intersection in the range between 13 and 23 km/h, (2) a significant change in the deceleration behaviour with a reduction in the proportion of drivers which did not decelerate, and (3) a shift away from the intersection of the deceleration beginning. Given the significant effects on drivers' behaviour, the dragon teeth markings, the colored intersection area, and the raised median island are strongly recommended for real world implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper shows that a regression tree problem can be turned into a classification tree problem reducing the computational cost and providing useful interpretation issues. A TWO-CLASS tree methodoloy for non-parametric regression analysis is introduced. Data are as follows: a numerical response variable and a set of predictors (of categorical and/or numerical type) are measured on a sample of objects, with no probability assumption. Thus a non-parametric approach is proposed. The concepts of prospective and retrospective splits are considered. Main idea is to grow a binary partition of the sample of objects such that, at each node of the tree structure, the numerical response is recoded into a dummy or two-class variable (called theoretical response) on the basis of the optimal partition of the objects into two groups within the set of retrospective splits. A two-stage splitting criterion with a fast algorithm is applied: the best split of the objects is found in the set of candidate (prospective) splits of each predictor modalities by maximizing the predictability of the two-class response. Some applications on real world cases and a simulation study allow to demonstrate that the two-class splitting procedure is computationally less intensive than standard regression tree such as CART. Furthermore, the final partitions obtained by the two-class procedure and the standard one are very similar to each other, in terms of percentage of objects belonging together to the same terminal node. Some aids to the interpretation allow to describe the response variable distribution in the terminal nodes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={The paper investigated drivers' speed behaviour in a section of a rural highway crossing a small urban community in the existing scenario without any traffic calming device and in two different design scenarios with traffic calming in the urban community. Two gateways and four integrative traffic calming devices along the route within the urban area were tested. The gateways were aimed at slowing down the vehicles entering in the built-up area, while the traffic calming devices were aimed at complementing the gateway effect inside the built-up area. Two design options were tested: first option (alt1) is a combination of low cost measures, whereas the second option (alt2) is more expensive as includes a chicane and requires land acquisition. Drivers' behaviour was investigated by means of a driving simulator experiment. The VERA dynamic-driving simulator operating at the TEST Road Safety Laboratory located in Naples (Italy) was used. Simulation results were validated by the comparison of speed behaviour in the real world and in the driving simulator, in the scenario without traffic calming. Analysis of the driving simulator experiment results was performed using two different approaches: (a) explorative description of data by cluster analysis; (b) inferential procedures about population using statistical tests. Cluster analysis was carried out in order to test if the drivers' speed behaviour in the different design alternatives was substantially different. Statistical tests were performed in order to verify if speeds in specific sections were significantly different. Cluster analysis looked at speed profiles, whereas statistical tests looked at speed data in specific points. The obtained results showed a different behaviour of drivers approaching the urban community in the existing scenario and in the design scenarios. In the south direction, mean speed reduction ranging between 16 and 17 km/h, with 5% level of significance, was observed. In the north direction, mean speed reduction equal to 11 km/h, with 10% level of significance, was observed. Differences between the two design alternatives were not statistically significant. Along the urban community, a statistically significant mean speed reduction ranging between 9 and 15 km/h was observed in the south direction. In the north direction, speed reduction was not statistically significant. Overall, combined results of cluster analysis and statistical tests showed that the treatments were more effective in the direction with higher speeds in the base scenario. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to investigate, by means of a dynamic driving simulator experiment, the behavior of road users at rural intersections in relation to perceptual measures designed for increasing hazard detection. In the experiment 10 configurations of tangents were tested: Alt1, base tangent; Alt2, four-leg base intersection; Alt3, intersection with reduced sight distance; and Alt4 through Alt10, intersections with perceptual treatments. The Virtual Environment for Road Safety high-fidelity dynamic-driving simulator, operating at the Technology Environment Safety Transport Road Safety Laboratory located in Naples, Italy, was used. Analysis of the results used two approaches: (a) explorative description of data by cluster analysis and (b) inferential procedures about population using statistical tests. Results showed that the speed behavior in the tangents was significantly affected by the presence of the intersections and by the perceptual treatments. Intersections without perceptual treatments significantly affected driver speeds in the 250 m preceding the intersection. Perceptual treatments helped the driver to detect the intersection earlier and to slow down. Dragon teeth markings, colored intersection area, and raised median island performed better than the other perceptual treatments. They produced significant average speed reduction in the 150 m preceding the intersection ranging between 16 km/h and 23 km/h. Study results support real-world implementation of perceptual measures in rural intersections because they are low-cost, fast implementation measures with a high potential to be cost-effective.},

abstract={The framework of this paper is classification and regression trees, also known as tree-based methods, binary segmentation, tree partitioning, decision trees. Trees can be fruitfully used either to explore and understand the dependence relationship between the response variable and a set of predictors or to assign the response class or value for new objects on which only the measurements of predictors are known. Since the introduction of two-stage splitting procedure in 1992, the research unit in Naples has been introducing several contributions in this field, one of the main issues is combining tree partitioning with statistical models. This paper will provide a new idea of knowledge extraction using trees and models. It will deal with the trade off between the interpretability of the tree structure (i.e., exploratory trees) and the accuracy of the decision tree model (i.e., decision tree-based rules). Prospective and retrospective view of using models and trees will be discussed. In particular, we will introduce a tree-based methodology that grows an optimal tree structure with the posterior prediction modelling to be used as decision rule for new objects. The general methodology will be presented and a special case will be described in details. An application on a real world data set will be finally shown.},

abstract={The framework of this paper is supervised learning using classification trees. Two types of variables play a role in the definition of the classification rule, namely a response variable and a set of predictors. The tree classifier is built up by a recursive partitioning of the prediction space such to provide internally homogeneous groups of objects with respect to the response classes. In the following, we consider the role played by an instrumental variable to stratify either the variables or the objects. This yields to introduce a tree-based methodology for conditional classification. Two special cases will be discussed to grow multiple discriminant trees and partial predictability trees. These approaches use discriminant analysis and predictability measures respectively. Empirical evidence of their usefulness will be shown in real case studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Data Fusion and Data Grafting are concerned with combining files and information coming from different sources. The problem is not to extract data from a single database, but to merge information collected from different sample surveys. The typical data fusion situation formed of two data samples, the former made up of a complete data matrix X relative to a first survey, and the latter Y which contains a certain number of missing variables. The aim is to complete the matrix Y beginning from the knowledge acquired from the X. Thus, the goal is the definition of the correlation structure which joins the two data matrices to be merged. In this paper, we provide an innovative methodology for Data Fusion based on an incremental imputation algorithm in tree-based models. In addition, we consider robust tree validation by boosting iterations. A relevant advantage of the proposed method is that it works for a mixed data structure including both numerical and categorical variables. As benchmarking methods we consider explicit methods such as standard trees and multiple regression as well as an implicit method based principal component analysis. A widely extended simulation study proves that the proposed method is more accurate than the other methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},
